old male patient with undiagnosed endobronchial anthracofibrosis before surgery , who developed severe endobronchial hemorrhage after endotracheal suction by a routine method performed in the recovery room . in the recovery room ,\nthe hemorrhage began while inserting a suction catheter through an endotracheal tube and aspirating airway secretion .\nalthough the blood was aspirated continuously , the volume did not decrease , and the patient was transported to the intensive care unit .\nbronchial endoscopy was performed to stop the hemorrhage , where at that time , together with a large hematoma , bronchial fibrosis and the deposition of dark pigment in a wide area of the right main bronchus adjacent to the carina were detected .\nthe patient showed repeated deterioration and improvement , and acute respiratory distress syndrome developed on the day 5 after surgery .\nthe patient died of multiple organ failure on day 63 after surgery . in our case , to reduce the risk of endobronchial hemorrhage , the amount of airway secretion was reduced using anticholinergic agents , and endotracheal suction using a suction catheter was not performed .\nthe entire length of the endotracheal tube ( mallincrodt medical inc . , ireland ) with a 7.0 mm\ninner diameter , which is generally used for the general anesthesia in adult women , is approximately 34 cm when it is firmly fitted with force to prevent the separation of the connector from a catheter .\nwhen a 12 fr suction catheter ( pvc suction catheter , qingdao sewoon medical co. ltd . , china ) was pushed to the end through this endotracheal tube , even the suction catheter completely passed the end of the endotracheal tube , and descends to the lumen of the bronchus by approximately 13 cm .\nif a 14 fr suction catheter with a slightly larger inner diameter is used , it would enter the lumen of the bronchus by approximately 12 cm .\nconsidering that the length of korean women from the upper incisors to the carina is approximately 18.5 - 25 cm , a suction catheter could enter the lumen of the lobar bronchus readily . in our case , pigment deposition plaque due to anthracofibrosis were formed at the distal area of right main broncus , and presented in the right middle and lower lobe and the left upper and lower lobe , too .\ntherefore , if endotracheal suction was performed without paying particular attention , a suction catheter possibly irritates the anthracofibrotic lesion at the distal area of the right main bronchus , and may induce the development of mass hemorrhage . the standard guidelines for the airway management for the cases with anthracofibrosis have not been established . in cases placing endotracheal tubes , particularly during the recovery of anesthesia , severe cough may develop due to bronchial stimulation and more hemodynamic changes may occur during the insertion and removal of the endotracheal tube .\nit is possible that in cases using the laryngeal mask airway , as in our case , direct airway stimulation on the vocal cord and the proximal area of trachea could be decreased relatively . nevertheless , if it is not installed accurately , saliva , etc .\nin addition , in cases with obstructive lung diseases due to endobronchial anthracofibrosis , adequate ventilation may be impossible with the laryngeal mask airway only . in our case ,\nsufficient ventilation was achieved only by the placement of a laryngeal mask airway , and the maintenance of anesthesia and recovery were achieved without a large amount of airway secretion . similar to surgery that must use a laparoscope , for cases in whom an endotracheal tube must be inserted because of the characteristics of surgery itself requiring a high airway pressure , it would be desirable to assess the accurate position of anthracofibrosis lesions by performing a bronchoscopic examination in advance , to use agents that could reduce the level of airway secretion , and to restrain the use of a suction catheter as much as possible . in conclusion , for anthracofibrosis patients , anesthesia plans should be made by considering the possibility of the development of severe hemorrhage within the bronchus if airway suction is performed without paying attention .\nin korea , where the incidence of tuberculosis is high , there is a strong likelihood of undiagnosed endobronchail anthracofibrosis in elderly women .\ntherefore , it is important to minimize airway stimulation . if continuous abnormal hemorrhage is detected after endotracheal suction , it is important to consider the possibility of massive hemorrhage within the bronchus caused by underlying anthracofibrosis .\nin addition , in cases with anthracofibrosis findings detected accidentally during the endobronchial manipulation using a bronchoscope , it is highly probable that undiagnosed tuberculosis would be the cause .", "reference_summary": "bronchial anthracosis was recently defined in the english radiology literature as a luminal narrowing associated with anthracotic pigmentation on bronchoscopy without a relevant history of pneumoconiosis or smoking . anthracosis refers to the presence of carbon particles in the lungs , not to a disorder per se . anthracofibrotic lesions carry the potential risk of massive hemorrhage during endobronchial procedures . this report describes a case of general anesthesia for a left modified radical mastectomy due to an intraductal carcinoma in a patient with known bronchial anthracofibrosis .", "summary": "A 77-year-old female patient was admitted for surgery due to intraductal carcinoma in the left breast.

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

{"uid": "MSumBench_0401", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_116", "summary_model": "anthropic/Claude-3.5-Sonnet", "input_text": "Most communities in the nation experience some kind of flooding, which may occur after substantial spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, winter snow thaws, or heavy storms over a large body of water. Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "The report examines the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' economic analyses of flood risk management projects. The Corps conducts feasibility studies following a six-step planning process to evaluate flood control projects, including economic analyses of benefits and costs. The review of eight feasibility studies found that the Corps generally met three of five key methodological elements for economic analysis but only partly met two elements - analysis of effects and transparency. The studies effectively stated objectives, compared alternatives, and showed clear writing/organization. However, they had limitations in fully quantifying all important benefits/costs and ensuring transparency regarding analytical choices and assumptions. The report recommends that the Corps strengthen its internal review process to improve transparency in feasibility studies by better documenting important assumptions, limitations, and their implications. This would help ensure decision-makers and stakeholders are better informed about the economic effects of flood risk management projects. The Department of Defense concurred with the recommendation and acknowledged that existing guidance could be strengthened to make transparency a more explicit review criterion.", "keyfacts": ["Flood risk management includes the use of structures and nonstructural measures.", "The Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects from 2015 to 2017.", "The largest amount requested was $1.33 billion for flood risk management projects.", "The Corps is located within the Department of Defense.", "The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works sets the strategic direction for the Civil Works Program.", "The Chief of Engineers is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions.", "The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters, regional divisions, and local district offices.", "The Corps develops water resource projects with nonfederal sponsors.", "The planning process begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem.", "The Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study.", "The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the planning process for water resources development projects.", "The federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the environment.", "The Corps uses four categories of analysis for evaluating project plans.", "Feasibility studies must present evaluations under National Economic Development and Environmental Quality categories.", "The Corps followed a six-step planning process for water resources development projects.", "The Corps identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for each project.", "The Corps inventoried historic and existing water and land resource conditions.", "The Corps formulated alternative plans for the project.", "The Corps evaluated each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects.", "The Corps compared the alternative plans to each other.", "The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans.", "The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies reviewed.", "The Corps included Environmental Quality analysis in all studies reviewed.", "The Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits in most studies.", "The Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency.", "The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should strengthen the Corps’ internal review process.", "The Department of Defense concurred with the recommendation to strengthen transparency."], "keyfacts_category": ["Regulation and Policy", "Financial information", "Financial information", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations"], "fv_label": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.875, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "ka_completeness": 0.2962962962962963, "ka_sentence_label": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.875}

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects.

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions.

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "This report examines the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (Corps) economic analyses of eight flood risk management feasibility studies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) assessed the Corps' adherence to best practices for economic analysis, finding that the analyses generally met three of five key methodological elements and partly met two. While the analyses were generally clear and well-documented, they lacked transparency in some areas, such as fully explaining the implications of key limitations in the models used and quantifying the statistical variability of the results. The GAO recommends that the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works direct the Corps to strengthen its internal review process to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency in economic analyses.

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed eight U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) feasibility studies for flood risk management projects, focusing on the economic analyses conducted. The Corps has three primary missions, including flood risk management. It requests funding for construction projects related to these missions.  The Corps follows a six-step planning process for water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives, outlined in its Planning Guidance.  Nonfederal sponsors participate throughout the process, from identifying the problem to post-project operations and maintenance. For projects where the Corps constructs infrastructure, the nonfederal sponsor is responsible for subsequent monitoring and maintenance costs. The GAO’s review assessed the Corps’ adherence to five key methodological elements for economic analysis: stating the action and its justification, identifying and comparing alternatives, quantifying and monetizing costs and benefits, ensuring transparency, and using net present value. The Corps generally met three elements, partly met two (analysis of effects and transparency).  A key finding was that while the Corps generally adhered to best practices for conducting economic analyses, it fell short in transparency.  Although analyses described some analytical choices, assumptions, and data used, they didn't fully explain or justify all. They also didn't always discuss implications of limitations in models and data. Additionally, while the Corps quantified and monetized most costs and benefits, it generally omitted loss of life valuations, a practice now being addressed in revised guidance.  The GAO recommends the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works direct the Chief of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies, ensuring consistency with best practices for transparency by verifying that all important assumptions, limitations, and their implications are consistently, clearly, and fully described.

{"uid": "MSumBench_0407", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_116", "summary_model": "openai/gpt-4o", "input_text": "Most communities in the nation experience some kind of flooding, which may occur after substantial spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, winter snow thaws, or heavy storms over a large body of water. Flood risk management includes the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps’ three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. Located within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities. Through the Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects such as navigation and flood risk projects. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, sets the strategic direction for the program and has principal responsibility for the overall supervision of functions relating to the Army’s Civil Works Program. The Chief of Engineers, a military officer, is responsible for execution of the civil works and military missions. The Civil Works Program is organized into three tiers: headquarters in Washington, D.C.; eight regional divisions; and 38 local district offices. (See fig. 2.) The Corps develops water resource projects, including flood risk management projects, in conjunction with nonfederal sponsors such as state and local governments. According to Corps guidance, the planning process for these projects begins with the nonfederal sponsor identifying a problem and approaching the Corps to help develop a solution. Upon congressional authorization for a study and appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor establish an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project. The Corps initiates a feasibility study by forming a project team comprised of Corps engineers, economists, planners, and possibly other specialists such as nonfederal consultants to conduct the study. The planning process the Corps uses to carry out feasibility studies is described later in our report. Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project operations and maintenance. For example, for projects in which the Corps constructs infrastructure such as a flood wall, the nonfederal sponsor is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs associated with the flood wall after its construction. The U.S. Water Resources Council’s Principles and Guidelines outlines the principles and procedures the Corps is to follow for planning water resources development projects, including those with flood risk management objectives. The Principles and Guidelines states that the federal objective of water resources development projects is to contribute to national economic development while protecting the nation’s environment. The Corps implements the planning process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines by conducting feasibility studies for proposed water resources development projects. The Corps’ Planning Guidance provides detailed guidance on how to implement the general process outlined in the Principles and Guidelines for planning water resource projects. The Corps’ National Economic Development manuals provide supplemental guidance for the economic analysis of different types of projects—including flood risk management—and how to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with each type of project. To identify the beneficial and adverse effects of each alternative plan considered for a project, the Corps uses four categories of analysis established in the Principles and Guidelines: (1) National Economic Development, (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Regional Economic Development, and (4) Other Social Effects, as shown in table 1. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states that feasibility studies may evaluate the effects of alternative plans using the four categories of analysis, but the evaluations under two categories—National Economic Development and Environmental Quality—must be presented in each feasibility study. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the National Economic Development category requires an economic analysis of each plan’s potential economic benefits and costs in monetary terms, while the Environmental Quality category evaluates each plan’s potential nonmonetary effects such as effects on habitat quality and quantity. The Planning Guidance states that using these categories of analysis provides a basis for determining which alternative plans should be eliminated from consideration, modified, or selected for further analysis. The Corps’ followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its Planning Guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for flood risk management projects and select a recommended plan for the eight feasibility studies we reviewed. In the initial three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) identified the objectives and other parameters of the project; (2) inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area; and (3) formulated alternative plans for further consideration. In the final three steps of the planning process, the Corps (1) evaluated and analyzed each alternative plan for its economic, environmental, and other effects, (2) compared the alternative plans to each other, and (3) selected a recommended plan. Corps officials told us that this six-step process is the basic template for planning water resources development projects across all Corps mission areas. (See fig. 3.) For each of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed this template and addressed each of the six steps in planning the proposed flood risk management project, as we describe below. Each study identified objectives, problems, opportunities, and constraints for the project. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, identification of problems and opportunities is the foundation for scoping the planning process and should begin as soon as practicable after the decision to initiate a feasibility study. Planning objectives describe the desired results of the process by solving the problems and taking advantage of the opportunities identified. Constraints are restrictions that limit the planning process and are unique to each study. Such constraints can be, for example, limitations imposed by policy or law. All of the studies we reviewed had the objective of reducing or managing flood risk and damages in response to problems such as historic river or stream flooding in the planning area. The studies identified opportunities, such as improving the community’s understanding of flood risk and resiliency from flood events. The studies also identified constraints, such as the need for the plan to incorporate extensive transportation infrastructure within some of the planning areas. The studies inventoried historic and existing water and related land resource conditions and forecasted future conditions within the planning area relevant to the identified problems and opportunities from step one. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps is to use quantitative and qualitative descriptions of critical resources in the planning area to define existing and future without-project conditions— that is, the conditions if no project is constructed. The defined without- project conditions provide the basis from which the Corps formulates alternative plans and assesses impacts. The studies we reviewed inventoried the existing conditions for the planning area. This inventory included geology, groundwater, surface water, hydrology, water quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use, recreation, air quality, climate change, transportation, public health and safety, public services, utilities, socioeconomics, and environmental justice. The Corps used these existing conditions to forecast the future without-project conditions, such as increasing flood risk for residential and industrial development, culturally significant communities, or specific infrastructure such as a regional wastewater facility. The studies formulated alternative plans for the project, including a range of structural and nonstructural measures and strategies. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, an alternative plan consists of a system of management measures, that is, structural and/or nonstructural measures, strategies, or programs formulated to meet the project objectives subject to the planning constraints. The Corps is to identify a range of alternative plans at the beginning of the planning process, screen the plans, and refine them in subsequent iterations throughout the planning process. The Planning Guidance also states that as the Corps develops the alternative plans, it must consider the criteria of completeness, efficiency, effectiveness, and acceptability. In the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps followed an iterative approach to identify measures and form alternative plans. For example, the studies generally identified an initial array of structural and nonstructural measures for conceptual screening, followed by the grouping of viable measures into alternative plans for screening under the criteria, resulting in an array of plan alternatives for more detailed analysis of the beneficial and adverse effects (monetary and nonmonetary) of each. According to Corps officials, flood risk management studies must consider a minimum of two plans— no action and an alternative—and one of the plans considered must be nonstructural. All eight studies we reviewed adhered to this requirement and considered a variety of alternative plans for each proposed flood risk management project. The studies evaluated each alternative plan—including its beneficial and adverse effects—through a comparison of the with-project and without- project conditions. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, evaluation consists of (1) forecasting the most likely with-project (e.g., with the alternative plan constructed) condition expected under each alternative plan; (2) comparing each with-project condition to the without-project condition and documenting the differences between the two; (3) characterizing the beneficial and adverse effects; and (4) identifying the plans that will be further considered in the planning process. The studies we reviewed used the categories established in Corps guidance— the National Economic Development and Regional Economic Development categories for monetary benefits and costs and the Environmental Quality and Other Social Effects categories for nonmonetary (quantitative and qualitative) effects—to evaluate and display the beneficial and adverse effects of plan alternatives. The categories and specific types of monetary benefits and costs and nonmonetary effects that the Corps evaluated varied for each study depending on the planning area conditions and the measures and strategies included in the alternative plans. In the studies we reviewed, the economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analysis of nonmonetary effects generally resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. The studies compared the alternative plans based on the economic analysis of benefits and costs and on the evaluations of environmental and other effects. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the alternative plans (including the no-action plan) are to be compared with each other, with emphasis on the outputs and beneficial and adverse effects that will have the most influence in the decision-making process. Such a comparison is to include monetary and nonmonetary benefits and costs and identify and document trade-offs to support the final recommendation. In the studies we reviewed, the Corps compared project effects in a variety of ways, for example, in a series of narratives describing the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans, or a grid for side-by-side comparison of selected effects for plan alternatives. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects. The result of this step was a final group of plans that the Corps considered for recommendation. The Corps recommended a plan based on the comparison of the alternative plans. According to the Corps’ Planning Guidance, the Corps should recommend a single alternative plan that must be shown to be preferable to taking no action (if no action is not recommended) or implementing any of the other alternatives considered during the planning process. In the studies we reviewed, the recommended plan and the rationale for its selection were identified in the analyses and underwent internal technical review at the district, division, and headquarters levels. The Chief of Engineers signed and submitted the proposed plan for the project—known as the Chief’s Report—to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for review, and the Secretary submitted the report to Congress for authorization. All eight of the studies we reviewed included step 4 of the Corps’ six-step planning process: an economic analysis of the benefits and costs of each proposed project as well as an Environmental Quality analysis, as called for in the Corps’ Planning Guidance. The inclusion of the other two types of analyses—Regional Economic Development and Other Social Effects—are not required, but six of the studies included them. The Principles and Guidelines provide the Corps with general flexibility to choose which benefit and cost categories to include in these analyses. The Corps’ Planning Guidance states the federal government’s and project’s objectives guide the planning process, which includes benefit and cost category selection. The monetary benefits most commonly included in the economic analyses of the Corps feasibility studies we reviewed were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, as shown in table 2. The Corps included reduced damage benefits in each of the eight studies we reviewed. Reduced damages result from actions such as performing physical modifications to property designed to reduce the frequency of flood damage, relocating structures, or installing flood warning and preparedness systems. For example, a feasibility study for a proposed project in the New York District outlined a plan to modify channels that line the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers with the goal of reducing the risk of life and property damage within the Village of Mamaroneck. The Corps also included emergency costs avoided as benefits in four of the eight studies we reviewed. Emergency costs include expenses resulting from a flood that otherwise would not be incurred. For example, some of the emergency costs avoided for this proposed project in the New York District included the costs of evacuation, reoccupation, flood fighting, and increased operations, police, fire, and military patrol. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some studies included monetary benefits from recreation, reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions in their economic analyses, but these were not commonly considered in the studies we reviewed. The Corps considered a variety of monetized costs in its economic analyses for feasibility studies we reviewed, as shown in table 3. Among the most commonly included costs in each of the eight studies were for construction; operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R); and real estate. Specifically: Construction costs. These are the direct costs of installing project measures. For example, the Honolulu District study included the costs of constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins above a watershed, floodwalls along a canal, an earthen levee, and two pump stations. OMRR&R costs. These represent the current monetary value of materials, equipment, services, and facilities needed to operate the project and make repairs, rehabilitations, and replacements necessary to maintain project measures in sound operating condition during the period of analysis. For example, the Wilmington District study included OMRR&R costs for conducting visual inspections of the levee, mowing twice a year, and conducting video inspections of pipes and culverts every 5 years. Real estate costs. These include activities such as buying out residential structures and demolishing them. For example, the San Francisco District study included real estate costs to acquire approximately 900 acres of city-owned land for ecosystem restoration and levee, road, and temporary work easements. Depending on the potential effects of the plan alternatives considered, some of the studies we reviewed included environmental costs; relocations; planning, engineering, and design; and the costs for cultural resource preservation, recreation, and flood warning systems. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Corps included other analyses to evaluate monetary and nonmonetary project effects in the flood risk management feasibility studies we reviewed. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. All the studies we reviewed included the Environmental Quality analysis; six studies included the Regional Economic Development or Other Social Effects analyses, as shown in table 4. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors’ preferences. Examples of some additional analyses conducted in different districts include the following: Regional Economic Development effects. In the Sacramento District study, the Corps considered ways reduced flooding could increase local business revenue and short-term construction employment but reduce employment because of loss of damage to businesses, among other effects. The Corps also considered how its expenditures for various services and products during the project were expected to generate additional economic activity, such as through additional jobs, income, and sales. In this case, the Corps estimated the project might add 18,930 jobs in the region. According to a 2011 Corps handbook, considering Regional Economic Development effects can provide a better understanding of the overall impact to the region. Doing so also examines the potential impacts mainly to the localized or regional economic area, instead of the nation as a whole. Other Social Effects. In the Wilmington District study, the Corps considered security of life, health, and safety; preservation of historic significance; and the impacts to cultural resources. According to a 2009 Corps handbook, considering the Other Social Effects analysis has great potential value for better ensuring that water resources solutions address a broad array of issues and concerns that better meet stakeholder needs and expectations. In most of the studies we reviewed, the Corps recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefits based on the results of its economic analyses. In some cases, however, the Corps relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. The Corps’ Planning Guidance directs that the project alternative with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation’s environment, be selected for recommendation unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. The Planning Guidance states that projects may deviate from the alternative plan with the maximum net benefits if requested by the nonfederal sponsor and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Such plan alternatives are referred to by the Corps as the locally preferred plan, with the nonfederal sponsor responsible for any project costs in excess of the costs of the plan with the highest net benefits. The Corps conducted economic analyses in each of the eight studies we reviewed, resulting in a wide range of monetary benefits and costs for the recommended project plan alternatives. Table 5 shows the monetized benefit and cost information that helped the Corps select recommended plans in the eight studies. The annualized project benefits ranged from approximately $500,000 to $210.6 million, and annualized project costs ranged from about $1 million to $65 million, resulting in annual net benefit estimates ranging from approximately -$500,000 to $146 million. For five of the eight studies we reviewed, the Corps primarily used the results of the economic analysis of benefits and costs to recommend a plan with the greatest net benefits from among the alternatives, in accordance with the Planning Guidance. These five studies were with the New York, Honolulu, Sacramento, Nashville, and Kansas City Corps districts. Three of the eight studies we reviewed relied on other analyses as allowed under the Planning Guidance to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses when needed to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local nonfederal sponsors’ preferences. Specifically: Chicago District. The Chicago District recommended a project based on two separate analyses. Specifically, the project team recommended an alternative plan based on an economic analysis for the flood risk management objective and separate analyses for an ecosystem restoration objective. A Corps document stated that by doing so, the proposed project would help both manage flood risks and restore ecosystems in the watershed. In addition, the study said the recommended plan attempts to maximize the net benefits and find balance between both objectives. Wilmington District. The Wilmington District study indicated that the Corps recommended the locally preferred alternative plan, after receiving approval to do so, instead of the alternative plan with the greatest net benefits at the request of the nonfederal sponsor. The locally preferred alternative plan was recommended so it could incorporate consideration of potential other social effects, such as life and safety risk, and regional economic development, such as employment created during and after construction. By doing so, the study indicated Corps officials responded to local priorities and the recommendations provided by the President’s Council on the Future of Princeville, North Carolina. According to the study, the Corps considered impacts to community cohesion, cultural and historical values, local per capita and household incomes in comparison to national averages, and other factors not captured in an economic analysis. San Francisco District. The San Francisco District study indicated that the Corps based its alternative plan recommendation on a combination of multiple objectives and local preference. The recommended alternative plan’s objectives included reducing the risk of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits— thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit. The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key elements—analysis of effects and transparency. Our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis (Assessment Methodology) identifies five key methodological elements to the baseline structure of an economic analysis. For the analysis of effects element, the Corps has either taken steps to address certain best practices or indicated the agency is limited in adopting other practices due to statutory requirements. For the transparency element, Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through its review process. According to our Assessment Methodology, an economic analysis should state the action examined and the justification for the action. In addition, the objective of the analysis should be stated; the scope of the analysis should be designed to address the objective; and the analysis period should be long enough to encompass the important economic effects of the proposed action. We found that all eight analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses indicated that the actions examined included the evaluation of flood risk management improvements for resolving flooding problems. In addition, the analyses provided specific planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs—a period that should be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu District’s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with any degree of certainty. In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District’s feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District’s study indicated that in developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives. In addition, the analysis should consider a range of relevant alternatives and should justify that the economic conditions specified under each alternative considered represent the best assessment of conditions under that alternative. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses examined the economic effect of the proposed flood control actions by comparing a range of alternatives, including various structures such as levees or bridge modifications, as well as nonstructural measures such as floodplain management activities or acquisition of land and removal of people from the flood plain. Moreover, the economic analyses in the studies generally described and justified the economic conditions that would be expected under each alternative. For the two studies that also evaluated ecosystem restoration alternatives, the studies considered alternatives for restoring ecosystems. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that the economic analysis be clearly written, include a plain language summary, and provide clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and the results. Also, the analysis should document that it complies with a robust quality assurance process. We found that all eight economic analyses generally met this key element. For example, all eight economic analyses were generally clearly written and included tables that generally described data and results. In addition, seven of the feasibility studies included a plain language summary. Six of the studies indicated that the analyses complied with a robust quality assurance process, in which the analyses were reviewed at the Corps district and by technical and policy experts in headquarters. Corps guidance indicates that the quality assurance process for feasibility studies involves reviews for technical quality and policy compliance, among other considerations, at the Corps district and in headquarters. Further, three studies indicated that an independent external peer review had been conducted. While one study completed in the Nashville District did not indicate whether the study complied with a quality assurance process, district officials told us a thorough review was conducted that included multiple district quality control reviews, agency technical review and headquarters policy reviews, and an independent external peer review. In addition, a study completed in the Chicago District did not indicate that it had undergone an independent external peer review. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an economic analysis quantify the important costs and benefits and monetize these quantitative effects using the concept of opportunity cost—the maximum worth of a good or input among possible alternatives. The criterion of net present value, or related outcome measures, should be applied to compare these effects across alternatives. In addition, the analysis should control for inflation and use economically justified discount rates. Where important costs and benefits cannot be quantified, the analysis should show how they affect the comparison of alternatives. We identified areas in which the studies did not fully align with certain best practices for various reasons, such as the Corps’ concerns about the reliability of available methods and statutory requirements regarding the use of discount rates. These best practices included: Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary, quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan. Specifically, the Sacramento District’s flood risk management study found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation methods but are monitoring other agencies’ efforts to value these effects and following economic research in the area. Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an “annualized” basis). However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits. Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and costs in “real” terms, the discount rates that the studies used to convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the Corps to use nominal discount rates. Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element. However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps’ recently revised guidance, which requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates. Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives. We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best practices related to transparency. Specifically: Being transparent with respect to analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the Wilmington District’s feasibility study relied on standardized “depth- damage curves” developed by the Corps’ New Orleans District. Corps guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial development with similar types of construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District’s economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis, however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating alternatives. Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis for the Sacramento District’s study indicated that the Corps’ Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced value of damageable property following a flood event. According to the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento District’s study reduced the overall value of properties in the floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance indicates that studies should provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District’s flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value. However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps’ Planning Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative. Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors, stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative. In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally, when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the 7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of the alternatives, according to these officials. Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside the team. For example, a project team’s analysis may not document every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials told us that teams rely on the Corps’ internal process for reviewing all planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and analyses. The officials stated that to improve transparency, the Corps could strengthen its internal review process, for example, by adding steps so that all of the important decisions and assumptions made in the analyses are consistently and clearly described. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with best practices for transparency, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about potential economic effects associated with such projects. The economic analyses included in Corps feasibility studies provide important information about the potential economic effects of flood risk management projects. While the economic analyses the Corps conducted for the eight studies we reviewed were generally consistent with several best practices, the Corps did not fully employ best practices pertaining to transparency. Because the information in the economic analyses can be complex and technical, following best practices for transparency helps ensure that the methods used to develop estimates and conclusions are clearly and fully presented. By conducting future economic analyses for potential flood risk management projects so they are more consistent with transparency best practices, the Corps can better ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are clearly and fully informed about the potential economic effects associated with flood risk management projects. We are making the following recommendation to the Department of Defense: The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works should direct the Chief of Engineers and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen the Corps’ internal review process for feasibility studies by including steps to ensure consistency with best practices for transparency, such as verifying that all of the important assumptions and limitations in models and their implications for the economic analysis are consistently, clearly, and fully described. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I, the Department concurred with our recommendation. The Department further stated that guidance related to ensuring transparency in feasibility studies and reviews already exists, but acknowledged that it can be strengthened and enforced more consistently by specifically identifying transparency as a review criterion. For example, they stated that the Corps plans to establish systematic guidance for meeting the transparency objective in preparing reports, assure transparency through the agency’s quality assurance process, and assess the degree of transparency as part of agency technical review and quality control assessment. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other interested parties.

The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under the Department of Defense, plays a critical role in flood risk management, one of its three primary missions, by using both structural and nonstructural measures to reduce loss of life and economic damage from flooding. From 2015 to 2017, $1.33 billion was requested for 33 flood risk management projects. USACE coordinates with nonfederal sponsors like state and local governments to develop and maintain water resources projects. The Corps follows a six-step planning process in evaluating project feasibility, which involves assessing alternative plans based on economic, environmental, and social effects. Economic analyses are conducted on potential benefits and costs, focusing on National Economic Development and Environmental Quality. While improvements have been made in quantifying certain aspects like loss of life, inconsistencies remain in transparency and fully explaining assumptions and limitations.

Here from our sister news organization, \"Time\" correspondent John Dickerson. John, thanks for coming in. We're going to be hearing a lot about gun control during this presidential campaign season, aren't we?</s>JOHN DICKERSON, \"TIME\" CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And Al Gore's going to be the one talking the most about it. There were some interesting polls last week. One of them, a battleground poll, showed that Gore is not doing as well with women, a traditionally-strong Democratic voting block. And one of the reasons is because George Bush has a strong education agenda that works with those women voters. Another issue that works well with those voters is guns. And that's why Al Gore will be talking about it; he thinks Bush has a real weakness there.</s>MESERVE: What is that weakness, as he perceives it?</s>DICKERSON: The weakness is that, in Texas, Bush has had a very strong pro-gun record; he has two pieces of legislation, the most important of which is the one that allows Texans to carry concealed hand guns. That's a piece of legislation Governor Bush was very happy and proud about; and now, in a general election, though, is one that might cause him some trouble.</s>MESERVE: Do you see Bush trying to moderate his position here? He has been somewhat critical of Mr. LaPierre in his remarks.</s>DICKERSON: Well, in some ways, LaPierre -- his remarks last week -- and now, LaPierre has not backed away from them -- helps the governor, Bush, because it allows Bush to look more moderate. Bush came out and said that the remarks were over the line. And it allows him to, then, look slightly more moderate. But again, important for Bush is his base does care about Second Amendment -- they do they do care about Second Amendment rights? And they will come out and vote if they think that Democrats are going to take away those rights.</s>MESERVE: So, ultimately, how does Bush position himself on this issue?</s>DICKERSON: Very, very carefully. He has to look like he's open to some kind of gun control, but he has to look, also, like he's not bowing to the media and the left-wing folks at the NRI -- the NRA, so exercise the bout.</s>MESERVE: Looking at LaPierre's remarks and reaction to it on Capitol Hill and elsewhere makes me ask this question: Has the NRA lost some influence and power as a force on Capitol Hill?</s>DICKERSON: The death of the NRA is always talked about, and it never really happens. And particularly on Capitol Hill, they still exert a tremendous amount of influence because, in district by district, there are a lot of Democrats who have a lot of NRA members in their districts, and they can't go along with a lot of this gun control, which means that the Republican-Democratic split that people talk about with gun control really doesn't exist, which means the NRA in specific districts can, in fact, have a lot of influence in this next election.</s>MESERVE: And meanwhile, you have Smith & Wesson reaching this agreement with the government. Well, how does this change the dynamic here? And does it force other gun makers to reach similar sorts of accord?</s>DICKERSON: Well, that's one of the most interesting things that happened last week. The nation's largest gun manufacturer has, essentially, capitulated to the government's demands on safety issues. And we remember from the tobacco situation, where it -- tobacco companies, at first, started caving in, and it caused a whole series of other tobacco companies to fall in line. We may see that here. Glock, another gun manufacturer, is already talking about, perhaps, agreeing to the same things that Smith & Wesson did. So, in fact, a lot of the Kabuki ritual in Congress, and the dance that goes on about politics and guns, may be irrelevant now, because gun manufacturers may take some of these measures on their own.</s>MESERVE: John Dickerson, \"Time\" magazine, thanks so much.

Here from our sister news organization, \"Time\" correspondent John Dickerson. John, thanks for coming in. We're going to be hearing a lot about gun control during this presidential campaign season, aren't we?</s>JOHN DICKERSON, \"TIME\" CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And Al Gore's going to be the one talking the most about it. There were some interesting polls last week. One of them, a battleground poll, showed that Gore is not doing as well with women, a traditionally-strong Democratic voting block. And one of the reasons is because George Bush has a strong education agenda that works with those women voters. Another issue that works well with those voters is guns. And that's why Al Gore will be talking about it; he thinks Bush has a real weakness there.</s>MESERVE: What is that weakness, as he perceives it?</s>DICKERSON: The weakness is that, in Texas, Bush has had a very strong pro-gun record; he has two pieces of legislation, the most important of which is the one that allows Texans to carry concealed hand guns. That's a piece of legislation Governor Bush was very happy and proud about; and now, in a general election, though, is one that might cause him some trouble.</s>MESERVE: Do you see Bush trying to moderate his position here? He has been somewhat critical of Mr. LaPierre in his remarks.</s>DICKERSON: Well, in some ways, LaPierre -- his remarks last week -- and now, LaPierre has not backed away from them -- helps the governor, Bush, because it allows Bush to look more moderate. Bush came out and said that the remarks were over the line. And it allows him to, then, look slightly more moderate. But again, important for Bush is his base does care about Second Amendment -- they do they do care about Second Amendment rights? And they will come out and vote if they think that Democrats are going to take away those rights.</s>MESERVE: So, ultimately, how does Bush position himself on this issue?</s>DICKERSON: Very, very carefully. He has to look like he's open to some kind of gun control, but he has to look, also, like he's not bowing to the media and the left-wing folks at the NRI -- the NRA, so exercise the bout.</s>MESERVE: Looking at LaPierre's remarks and reaction to it on Capitol Hill and elsewhere makes me ask this question: Has the NRA lost some influence and power as a force on Capitol Hill?</s>DICKERSON: The death of the NRA is always talked about, and it never really happens. And particularly on Capitol Hill, they still exert a tremendous amount of influence because, in district by district, there are a lot of Democrats who have a lot of NRA members in their districts, and they can't go along with a lot of this gun control, which means that the Republican-Democratic split that people talk about with gun control really doesn't exist, which means the NRA in specific districts can, in fact, have a lot of influence in this next election.</s>MESERVE: And meanwhile, you have Smith & Wesson reaching this agreement with the government. Well, how does this change the dynamic here?

Here from our sister news organization, \"Time\" correspondent John Dickerson. John, thanks for coming in. We're going to be hearing a lot about gun control during this presidential campaign season, aren't we?</s>JOHN DICKERSON, \"TIME\" CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And Al Gore's going to be the one talking the most about it. There were some interesting polls last week. One of them, a battleground poll, showed that Gore is not doing as well with women, a traditionally-strong Democratic voting block. And one of the reasons is because George Bush has a strong education agenda that works with those women voters. Another issue that works well with those voters is guns. And that's why Al Gore will be talking about it; he thinks Bush has a real weakness there.</s>MESERVE: What is that weakness, as he perceives it?</s>DICKERSON: The weakness is that, in Texas, Bush has had a very strong pro-gun record; he has two pieces of legislation, the most important of which is the one that allows Texans to carry concealed hand guns. That's a piece of legislation Governor Bush was very happy and proud about; and now, in a general election, though, is one that might cause him some trouble.</s>MESERVE: Do you see Bush trying to moderate his position here? He has been somewhat critical of Mr. LaPierre in his remarks.</s>DICKERSON: Well, in some ways, LaPierre -- his remarks last week -- and now, LaPierre has not backed away from them -- helps the governor, Bush, because it allows Bush to look more moderate. Bush came out and said that the remarks were over the line. And it allows him to, then, look slightly more moderate. But again, important for Bush is his base does care about Second Amendment -- they do they do care about Second Amendment rights? And they will come out and vote if they think that Democrats are going to take away those rights.</s>MESERVE: So, ultimately, how does Bush position himself on this issue?</s>DICKERSON: Very, very carefully. He has to look like he's open to some kind of gun control, but he has to look, also, like he's not bowing to the media and the left-wing folks at the NRI -- the NRA, so exercise the bout.</s>MESERVE: Looking at LaPierre's remarks and reaction to it on Capitol Hill and elsewhere makes me ask this question: Has the NRA lost some influence and power as a force on Capitol Hill?</s>DICKERSON: The death of the NRA is always talked about, and it never really happens. And particularly on Capitol Hill, they still exert a tremendous amount of influence because, in district by district, there are a lot of Democrats who have a lot of NRA members in their districts, and they can't go along with a lot of this gun control, which means that the Republican-Democratic split that people talk about with gun control really doesn't exist, which means the NRA in specific districts can, in fact, have a lot of influence in this next election.</s>MESERVE: And meanwhile, you have Smith & Wesson reaching this agreement with the government. Well, how does this change the dynamic here? And does it force other gun makers to reach similar sorts of accord?</s>DICKERSON: Well, that's one of the most interesting things that happened last week. The nation's largest gun manufacturer has, essentially, capitulated to the government's demands on safety issues. And we remember from the tobacco situation, where it -- tobacco companies, at first, started caving in, and it caused a whole series of other tobacco companies to fall in line. We may see that here. Glock, another gun manufacturer, is already talking about, perhaps, agreeing to the same things that Smith & Wesson did. So, in fact, a lot of the Kabuki ritual in Congress, and the dance that goes on about politics and guns, may be irrelevant now, because gun manufacturers may take some of these measures on their own.</s>MESERVE: John Dickerson, \"Time\" magazine, thanks so much.

"全国大部分社区都经历过某种形式的洪水，这可能发生在春季大量降雨后、强雷暴期间、冬季积雪融化后或大面积水体上空的强风暴期间。\n洪水风险管理包括适当使用堤坝和防洪墙等结构性措施，以及土地征收和建筑物迁移等非结构性措施，以降低生命损失风险，减少对公共和私营部门的长期经济损失，并改善自然环境。\n洪水风险管理是工程兵团三大主要任务之一。\n在2015至2017财年期间，工程兵团为其三大任务范围内的71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元，其中最大的资金数额——13.3亿美元——用于洪水风险管理任务下的33个建设项目。\n隶属于国防部的工程兵团承担着军事和民用职责。\n通过民用工程计划，工程兵团规划、建设、运营和维护包括航运和洪水风险项目在内的广泛水资源开发项目。\n由总统任命并经参议院确认的陆军民用工程助理部长为该计划制定战略方向，并主要负责与陆军民用工程计划相关职能的总体监督。\n工程师长（军官）负责执行民用工程和军事任务。\n民用工程计划分为三级：位于华盛顿特区的总部、八个区域分部和38个地方区办事处。\n（见图2。）\n工程兵团与州和地方政府等非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目，包括洪水风险管理项目。\n根据工程兵团的指导，这些项目的规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题并向工程兵团寻求帮助以开发解决方案。\n在国会授权研究并拨款资助后，工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议，以对潜在项目进行可行性研究。\n工程兵团通过组建由工程兵团工程师、经济学家、规划师以及可能包括非联邦顾问等其他专家组成的项目团队启动可行性研究。\n工程兵团用于执行可行性研究的规划过程将在本报告后续部分中描述。\n非联邦资助方应参与规划过程，并在项目设计、建设以及后续运营和维护中持续参与。\n例如，在工程兵团建设防洪墙等基础设施的项目中，非联邦资助方需承担防洪墙建成后的监测和维护费用。\n美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了工程兵团在规划水资源开发项目（包括洪水风险管理项目）时应遵循的原则和程序。\n《原则与指南》指出，水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护国家环境。\n工程兵团通过对拟议的水资源开发项目进行可行性研究来实施《原则与指南》中概述的规划过程。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》提供了关于如何实施《原则与指南》中概述的水资源项目规划通用流程的详细指导。\n工程兵团的《国家经济发展手册》为不同类型项目（包括洪水风险管理）的经济分析以及如何评估每种项目的相关收益和成本提供了补充指导。\n为识别每个项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，工程兵团使用《原则与指南》中确立的四类分析： (1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

(1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "这篇文本主要讨论了美国工程兵团的洪水风险管理项目规划和评估过程。主要内容包括：1) 工程兵团负责规划、建设和维护水资源项目，包括洪水风险管理；2) 工程兵团遵循六步规划流程，包括确定目标、评估条件、制定方案、分析影响、比较方案和选择推荐方案；3) 项目评估包括四类分析：国家经济发展、环境质量、区域经济发展和其他社会效应；4) 经济分析主要考虑减少损失和避免紧急成本等货币化收益，以及建设、运营维护和房地产等成本；5) 推荐方案通常选择具有最大净经济收益的方案，但也会考虑环境影响和地方偏好；6) 对八个案例研究的分析显示，工程兵团的经济分析基本符合关键方法要素，但在效果分析和透明度方面仍有改进空间。", "keyfacts": ["洪水风险管理包括使用结构性措施和非结构性措施。", "工程兵团在2015至2017财年期间为71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元。", "申请的最大金额是13.3亿美元用于洪水风险管理项目。", "工程兵团隶属于国防部。", "陆军民用工程助理部长为民用工程计划制定战略方向。", "工程师长负责执行民用工程和军事任务。", "民用工程计划分为三级：总部、区域分部和地方区办事处。", "工程兵团与非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目。", "规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题。", "工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议以进行可行性研究。", "美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了水资源开发项目的规划过程。", "水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护环境。", "工程兵团使用四类分析来评估项目计划。", "可行性研究必须在国家经济发展和环境质量类别下进行评估。", "工程兵团遵循六步规划过程进行水资源开发项目。", "工程兵团为每个项目确定了目标、问题、机会和限制条件。", "工程兵团清查了历史及现有的水资源和土地资源状况。", "工程兵团为项目制定了备选方案。", "工程兵团评估了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响。", "工程兵团将备选方案相互比较。", "工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。", "工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中进行了经济分析。", "工程兵团在所有审查的研究中包括了环境质量分析。", "工程兵团在大多数研究中推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。", "工程兵团未完全采用与透明度相关的最佳实践。", "陆军民用工程助理部长应加强工程兵团的内部审查过程。", "国防部同意加强透明度的建议。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Regulation and Policy", "Financial information", "Financial information", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations"], "fv_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.0, "ka_keyfact_label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.4444444444444444, "ka_sentence_label": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 1.0}

"全国大部分社区都经历过某种形式的洪水，这可能发生在春季大量降雨后、强雷暴期间、冬季积雪融化后或大面积水体上空的强风暴期间。\n洪水风险管理包括适当使用堤坝和防洪墙等结构性措施，以及土地征收和建筑物迁移等非结构性措施，以降低生命损失风险，减少对公共和私营部门的长期经济损失，并改善自然环境。\n洪水风险管理是工程兵团三大主要任务之一。\n在2015至2017财年期间，工程兵团为其三大任务范围内的71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元，其中最大的资金数额——13.3亿美元——用于洪水风险管理任务下的33个建设项目。\n隶属于国防部的工程兵团承担着军事和民用职责。\n通过民用工程计划，工程兵团规划、建设、运营和维护包括航运和洪水风险项目在内的广泛水资源开发项目。\n由总统任命并经参议院确认的陆军民用工程助理部长为该计划制定战略方向，并主要负责与陆军民用工程计划相关职能的总体监督。\n工程师长（军官）负责执行民用工程和军事任务。\n民用工程计划分为三级：位于华盛顿特区的总部、八个区域分部和38个地方区办事处。\n（见图2。）\n工程兵团与州和地方政府等非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目，包括洪水风险管理项目。\n根据工程兵团的指导，这些项目的规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题并向工程兵团寻求帮助以开发解决方案。\n在国会授权研究并拨款资助后，工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议，以对潜在项目进行可行性研究。\n工程兵团通过组建由工程兵团工程师、经济学家、规划师以及可能包括非联邦顾问等其他专家组成的项目团队启动可行性研究。\n工程兵团用于执行可行性研究的规划过程将在本报告后续部分中描述。\n非联邦资助方应参与规划过程，并在项目设计、建设以及后续运营和维护中持续参与。\n例如，在工程兵团建设防洪墙等基础设施的项目中，非联邦资助方需承担防洪墙建成后的监测和维护费用。\n美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了工程兵团在规划水资源开发项目（包括洪水风险管理项目）时应遵循的原则和程序。\n《原则与指南》指出，水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护国家环境。\n工程兵团通过对拟议的水资源开发项目进行可行性研究来实施《原则与指南》中概述的规划过程。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》提供了关于如何实施《原则与指南》中概述的水资源项目规划通用流程的详细指导。\n工程兵团的《国家经济发展手册》为不同类型项目（包括洪水风险管理）的经济分析以及如何评估每种项目的相关收益和成本提供了补充指导。\n为识别每个项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，工程兵团使用《原则与指南》中确立的四类分析： (1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

(1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1)

确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

"全国大部分社区都经历过某种形式的洪水，这可能发生在春季大量降雨后、强雷暴期间、冬季积雪融化后或大面积水体上空的强风暴期间。\n洪水风险管理包括适当使用堤坝和防洪墙等结构性措施，以及土地征收和建筑物迁移等非结构性措施，以降低生命损失风险，减少对公共和私营部门的长期经济损失，并改善自然环境。\n洪水风险管理是工程兵团三大主要任务之一。\n在2015至2017财年期间，工程兵团为其三大任务范围内的71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元，其中最大的资金数额——13.3亿美元——用于洪水风险管理任务下的33个建设项目。\n隶属于国防部的工程兵团承担着军事和民用职责。\n通过民用工程计划，工程兵团规划、建设、运营和维护包括航运和洪水风险项目在内的广泛水资源开发项目。\n由总统任命并经参议院确认的陆军民用工程助理部长为该计划制定战略方向，并主要负责与陆军民用工程计划相关职能的总体监督。\n工程师长（军官）负责执行民用工程和军事任务。\n民用工程计划分为三级：位于华盛顿特区的总部、八个区域分部和38个地方区办事处。\n（见图2。）\n工程兵团与州和地方政府等非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目，包括洪水风险管理项目。\n根据工程兵团的指导，这些项目的规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题并向工程兵团寻求帮助以开发解决方案。\n在国会授权研究并拨款资助后，工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议，以对潜在项目进行可行性研究。\n工程兵团通过组建由工程兵团工程师、经济学家、规划师以及可能包括非联邦顾问等其他专家组成的项目团队启动可行性研究。\n工程兵团用于执行可行性研究的规划过程将在本报告后续部分中描述。\n非联邦资助方应参与规划过程，并在项目设计、建设以及后续运营和维护中持续参与。\n例如，在工程兵团建设防洪墙等基础设施的项目中，非联邦资助方需承担防洪墙建成后的监测和维护费用。\n美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了工程兵团在规划水资源开发项目（包括洪水风险管理项目）时应遵循的原则和程序。\n《原则与指南》指出，水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护国家环境。\n工程兵团通过对拟议的水资源开发项目进行可行性研究来实施《原则与指南》中概述的规划过程。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》提供了关于如何实施《原则与指南》中概述的水资源项目规划通用流程的详细指导。\n工程兵团的《国家经济发展手册》为不同类型项目（包括洪水风险管理）的经济分析以及如何评估每种项目的相关收益和成本提供了补充指导。\n为识别每个项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，工程兵团使用《原则与指南》中确立的四类分析： (1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

(1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices. The agency concurred with the recommendation.", "summary": "这份报告评估了美国陆军工程兵团的洪水风险管理项目规划流程。报告审查了八项可行性研究，涵盖了工程兵团的六步规划流程，包括确定项目目标、清查和预测资源状况、制定备选方案、评估方案影响、比较备选方案和选择推荐方案。虽然大多数研究推荐了净收益最高的方案，但也有一些研究根据当地偏好或多重目标推荐了其他方案。报告还评估了这些研究的经济分析，发现它们通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足了另外两个要素——效果分析和透明度。报告指出，工程兵团已采取措施解决效果分析方面的一些最佳实践，但透明度方面仍有改进空间。报告还详细介绍了经济分析中考虑的常见收益和成本类型，包括减少损失、避免的紧急成本、建设成本、运营和维护成本以及房地产成本。此外，报告还讨论了除经济分析外，还进行的其他分析，如环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析，以帮助决策过程。", "keyfacts": ["洪水风险管理包括使用结构性措施和非结构性措施。", "工程兵团在2015至2017财年期间为71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元。", "申请的最大金额是13.3亿美元用于洪水风险管理项目。", "工程兵团隶属于国防部。", "陆军民用工程助理部长为民用工程计划制定战略方向。", "工程师长负责执行民用工程和军事任务。", "民用工程计划分为三级：总部、区域分部和地方区办事处。", "工程兵团与非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目。", "规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题。", "工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议以进行可行性研究。", "美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了水资源开发项目的规划过程。", "水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护环境。", "工程兵团使用四类分析来评估项目计划。", "可行性研究必须在国家经济发展和环境质量类别下进行评估。", "工程兵团遵循六步规划过程进行水资源开发项目。", "工程兵团为每个项目确定了目标、问题、机会和限制条件。", "工程兵团清查了历史及现有的水资源和土地资源状况。", "工程兵团为项目制定了备选方案。", "工程兵团评估了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响。", "工程兵团将备选方案相互比较。", "工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。", "工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中进行了经济分析。", "工程兵团在所有审查的研究中包括了环境质量分析。", "工程兵团在大多数研究中推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。", "工程兵团未完全采用与透明度相关的最佳实践。", "陆军民用工程助理部长应加强工程兵团的内部审查过程。", "国防部同意加强透明度的建议。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Regulation and Policy", "Financial information", "Financial information", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations"], "fv_label": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 1.0, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.37037037037037035, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.8571428571428571}

"全国大部分社区都经历过某种形式的洪水，这可能发生在春季大量降雨后、强雷暴期间、冬季积雪融化后或大面积水体上空的强风暴期间。\n洪水风险管理包括适当使用堤坝和防洪墙等结构性措施，以及土地征收和建筑物迁移等非结构性措施，以降低生命损失风险，减少对公共和私营部门的长期经济损失，并改善自然环境。\n洪水风险管理是工程兵团三大主要任务之一。\n在2015至2017财年期间，工程兵团为其三大任务范围内的71个建设项目申请了超过30亿美元，其中最大的资金数额——13.3亿美元——用于洪水风险管理任务下的33个建设项目。\n隶属于国防部的工程兵团承担着军事和民用职责。\n通过民用工程计划，工程兵团规划、建设、运营和维护包括航运和洪水风险项目在内的广泛水资源开发项目。\n由总统任命并经参议院确认的陆军民用工程助理部长为该计划制定战略方向，并主要负责与陆军民用工程计划相关职能的总体监督。\n工程师长（军官）负责执行民用工程和军事任务。\n民用工程计划分为三级：位于华盛顿特区的总部、八个区域分部和38个地方区办事处。\n（见图2。）\n工程兵团与州和地方政府等非联邦资助方合作开发水资源项目，包括洪水风险管理项目。\n根据工程兵团的指导，这些项目的规划过程始于非联邦资助方发现问题并向工程兵团寻求帮助以开发解决方案。\n在国会授权研究并拨款资助后，工程兵团与非联邦资助方达成协议，以对潜在项目进行可行性研究。\n工程兵团通过组建由工程兵团工程师、经济学家、规划师以及可能包括非联邦顾问等其他专家组成的项目团队启动可行性研究。\n工程兵团用于执行可行性研究的规划过程将在本报告后续部分中描述。\n非联邦资助方应参与规划过程，并在项目设计、建设以及后续运营和维护中持续参与。\n例如，在工程兵团建设防洪墙等基础设施的项目中，非联邦资助方需承担防洪墙建成后的监测和维护费用。\n美国水资源委员会的《原则与指南》概述了工程兵团在规划水资源开发项目（包括洪水风险管理项目）时应遵循的原则和程序。\n《原则与指南》指出，水资源开发项目的联邦目标是促进国家经济发展，同时保护国家环境。\n工程兵团通过对拟议的水资源开发项目进行可行性研究来实施《原则与指南》中概述的规划过程。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》提供了关于如何实施《原则与指南》中概述的水资源项目规划通用流程的详细指导。\n工程兵团的《国家经济发展手册》为不同类型项目（包括洪水风险管理）的经济分析以及如何评估每种项目的相关收益和成本提供了补充指导。\n为识别每个项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，工程兵团使用《原则与指南》中确立的四类分析： (1) 国家经济发展，(2) 环境质量，(3) 区域经济发展，(4) 其他社会效应，如表1所示。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，可行性研究可以使用四类分析对备选方案的影响进行评估，但每项可行性研究必须包含对两类分析——国家经济发展和环境质量——的评估。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，国家经济发展类别要求对每项计划的潜在经济收益和成本进行货币化分析，而环境质量类别则评估每项计划的潜在非货币影响，例如对栖息地质量和数量的影响。\n《规划指南》指出，使用这些分析类别为决定应淘汰、修改或选择哪些备选方案以进行进一步分析提供了依据。\n工程兵团遵循其《规划指南》中概述的水资源开发项目六步规划过程，识别并评估洪水风险管理项目备选方案的有利和不利影响，并为我们审查的八项可行性研究选择了推荐方案。\n在规划过程的前三步中，工程兵团 (1) 确定了项目的目标和其他参数； (2) 清查并预测了规划区域内的水资源及相关土地资源状况； (3) 制定了供进一步考虑的备选方案。\n在规划过程的后三步中，工程兵团 (1) 评估并分析了每个备选方案的经济、环境及其他影响； (2) 比较了各个备选方案； (3) 选择了推荐方案。\n工程兵团官员告诉我们，这一六步流程是规划所有工程兵团任务领域内水资源开发项目的基本模板。\n（见图3。）\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团按照这一模板，完成了拟议的洪水风险管理项目规划的六个步骤，如下所述。\n每项研究都确定了项目的目标、问题、机会和限制条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，问题和机会的识别是确定规划过程范围的基础，应在决定启动可行性研究后尽快开始。\n规划目标描述了通过解决已识别的问题和利用已识别的机会而期望实现的结果。\n限制条件是限制规划过程的约束条件，且每项研究都具有独特性。\n此类限制条件可以是政策或法律规定的限制。\n我们审查的所有研究都以减少或管理洪水风险和损失为目标，以应对规划区域内如历史性河流或溪流洪水等问题。\n这些研究确定了诸如提高社区对洪水风险的理解和增强应对洪水事件的韧性等机会。\n研究还识别了诸如规划需要纳入某些规划区域内广泛的交通基础设施等限制条件。\n研究清查了规划区域内与第一步中确定的问题和机会相关的历史及现有水资源和相关土地资源条件，并预测了未来条件。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应使用规划区域内关键资源的定量和定性描述来定义现有和未来的无项目条件，即未建设项目时的状况。\n定义的无项目条件为工程兵团制定备选方案和评估影响提供了基础。\n我们审查的研究清查了规划区域的现有条件。\n清查内容包括地质、地下水、地表水、水文、水质、生物资源、文化资源、土地利用、娱乐、空气质量、气候变化、交通、公共健康和安全、公共服务、公用设施、社会经济状况和环境正义。\n工程兵团利用这些现有条件预测了未来的无项目条件，例如居民和工业开发、文化意义重大的社区或区域废水处理设施等特定基础设施的洪水风险增加。\n研究为项目制定了备选方案，包括一系列结构性和非结构性措施及策略。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案由一套管理措施组成，即为满足规划约束条件下的项目目标而制定的结构性和/或非结构性措施、策略或计划。\n工程兵团应在规划过程开始时确定一系列备选方案，筛选这些方案，并在规划过程中通过后续迭代对其进行改进。\n《规划指南》还指出，在工程兵团制定备选方案时，必须考虑完整性、效率、有效性和可接受性标准。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团采用迭代方法确定措施并制定备选方案。\n例如，研究通常确定了一组初步的结构性和非结构性措施进行概念筛选，然后将可行措施分组为备选方案，依据标准对其进行筛选，最终形成一系列备选方案以更详细地分析每项方案的有利和不利影响（包括货币化和非货币化影响）。\n根据工程兵团官员的说法，洪水风险管理研究必须至少考虑两种方案——无行动方案和一种备选方案，且所考虑的方案中必须至少有一种是非结构性的。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均遵循这一要求，并为每个拟议的洪水风险管理项目考虑了多种备选方案。\n研究通过比较有项目和无项目条件对每个备选方案进行了评估，包括其有利和不利影响。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，评估包括：(1) 预测每项备选方案下最可能的有项目条件（例如，实施备选方案后的条件）；(2) 将每个有项目条件与无项目条件进行比较，并记录两者之间的差异；(3) 描述有利和不利影响；(4) 确定将在规划过程中进一步考虑的方案。\n我们审查的研究使用了工程兵团指南中设定的类别——国家经济发展和区域经济发展类别用于货币化收益和成本，环境质量和其他社会效应类别用于非货币化（定量和定性）影响——以评估和展示备选方案的有利和不利影响。\n工程兵团评估的货币化收益和成本以及非货币化影响的类别和具体类型因规划区域条件和备选方案中包含的措施和策略而异。\n在我们审查的研究中，货币化影响的经济分析通常得出了实施每种备选方案所预期的净收益的估计值（收益减去成本），而非货币化影响的分析通常得出工程兵团对每种备选方案净定性影响或净定量影响（例如，新增栖息地单位净值）的判断。\n研究根据收益和成本的经济分析以及环境和其他影响的评估对备选方案进行了比较。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，备选方案（包括无行动方案）应相互比较，重点关注对决策过程影响最大的产出以及有利和不利影响。\n这种比较应包括货币化和非货币化的收益和成本，并识别和记录权衡，以支持最终的推荐。\n在我们审查的研究中，工程兵团通过多种方式比较了项目影响，例如通过一系列叙述描述备选方案的有利和不利影响，或通过表格并列比较备选方案的选定影响。\n在一些研究中，这种比较包括一个渐进过程，工程兵团考虑将额外的措施或方法纳入某一备选方案，以进一步优化有利与不利影响之间的权衡。\n这一步骤的结果是工程兵团最终确定了一组拟推荐的方案。\n工程兵团根据备选方案的比较推荐了一项方案。\n根据工程兵团的《规划指南》，工程兵团应推荐一个备选方案，并证明其优于无行动方案（如果无行动方案未被推荐）或规划过程中考虑的其他任何备选方案。\n在我们审查的研究中，推荐方案及其选择理由在分析中明确，并在区、分部和总部级别进行了内部技术审查。\n工程师长签署并提交了项目拟议方案（即“工程师长报告”）至助理部长办公室审核，随后部长将报告提交国会授权。\n我们审查的所有八项研究均包括工程兵团六步规划过程中的第四步：对每个拟议项目的收益和成本进行经济分析，以及按照工程兵团《规划指南》要求进行环境质量分析。\n其他两种分析——区域经济发展和其他社会效应——并非必需，但六项研究包括了这些分析。\n《原则与指南》为工程兵团提供了在这些分析中选择包含哪些收益和成本类别的总体灵活性。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指出，联邦政府和项目的目标指导规划过程，包括收益和成本类别的选择。\n我们审查的工程兵团可行性研究的经济分析中最常见的货币化收益是减少的损失和避免的紧急成本，如表2所示。\n工程兵团在我们审查的八项研究中均纳入了减少损失的收益。\n减少的损失来源于诸如对财产进行旨在降低洪水损害频率的物理改造、搬迁建筑物或安装洪水预警和应急系统等行动。\n例如，纽约区一个拟议项目的可行性研究概述了一项计划，旨在改造玛玛罗内克河和谢尔德雷克河沿岸的河道，以减少玛玛罗内克村的生命和财产损失风险。\n工程兵团还在我们审查的八项研究中的四项研究中将避免的紧急成本作为收益。\n紧急成本包括因洪水而产生的原本不会发生的费用。\n例如，纽约区这一拟议项目避免的一些紧急成本包括疏散、重新安置、抗洪、增加运营以及警察、消防和军事巡逻的费用。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，一些研究在其经济分析中包括了来自娱乐、减少的维护成本、洪水保险管理节约或减少的交通中断的货币化收益，但这些在我们审查的研究中并不常见。\n工程兵团在我们审查的可行性研究的经济分析中考虑了多种货币化成本，如表3所示。\n在八项研究中最常见的成本包括建设成本；运营、维护、修理、更换和复原（OMRR&R）成本；以及房地产成本。\n具体而言：建设成本。\n这是安装项目措施的直接成本。\n例如，檀香山区的研究包括了在流域上方建设六个河道内碎屑和蓄水池、沿运河的防洪墙、一座土堤和两个泵站的成本。\nOMRR&R成本。\n这些成本代表了在分析期间需要运营项目并进行必要的修理、复原和更换以保持项目措施处于良好运行状态所需的材料、设备、服务和设施的现值。\n例如，威尔明顿区的研究包括堤坝的目视检查费用、每年两次的修剪费用以及每5年一次的管道和涵洞的视频检查费用。\n房地产成本。\n这些包括购买住宅建筑物并将其拆除等活动。\n例如，旧金山区的研究包括购买约900英亩市政土地用于生态系统恢复、堤坝、道路及临时工作通行权的房地产成本。\n根据所考虑的备选方案的潜在影响，我们审查的一些研究包括了环境成本、搬迁、规划、工程和设计的成本，以及文化资源保护、娱乐和洪水预警系统的成本。\n除了对收益和成本的必要经济分析外，工程兵团还在我们审查的洪水风险管理可行性研究中纳入了其他分析，以评估项目的货币化和非货币化影响。\n这些分析包括环境质量分析、区域经济发展分析和其他社会效应分析。\n我们审查的所有研究均包括环境质量分析；六项研究包括区域经济发展或其他社会效应分析，如表4所示。\n工程兵团官员表示，研究中纳入这些额外分析是因为需要通过这些分析来确定最佳项目设计、协助规划决策或响应当地资助方的偏好。\n不同地区进行的一些额外分析的例子包括以下内容：\n区域经济发展影响。\n在萨克拉门托区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了减少洪水如何能够增加当地企业收入和短期建筑就业，但也可能因企业损失导致就业减少等影响。\n工程兵团还考虑了项目期间对各种服务和产品的支出如何通过新增就业、收入和销售产生额外经济活动。\n在这种情况下，工程兵团估计该项目可能在该地区增加18,930个就业岗位。\n根据2011年工程兵团手册，考虑区域经济发展影响可以更好地理解对区域整体的影响。\n这样做还可以研究主要针对局部或区域经济区域的潜在影响，而不是对整个国家的影响。\n其他社会效应。\n在威尔明顿区的研究中，工程兵团考虑了生命、健康和安全的保障；历史意义的保护；以及对文化资源的影响。\n根据2009年工程兵团手册，考虑其他社会效应分析具有很大的潜在价值，可以更好地确保水资源解决方案解决更广泛的问题和关注点，以更好地满足利益相关者的需求和期望。\n在我们审查的大多数研究中，工程兵团根据经济分析的结果推荐了具有最大净经济收益的备选方案。\n然而，在某些情况下，工程兵团依赖其他分析来解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团的《规划指南》指示，除非获得例外许可，否则应选择与保护国家环境一致并具有最大净经济收益的项目备选方案进行推荐。\n如果存在联邦、州、地方或国际问题，陆军民用工程助理部长有权授予例外。\n《规划指南》指出，如果非联邦资助方提出请求并获得陆军民用工程助理部长的批准，项目可以偏离具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n这种备选方案被工程兵团称为“当地优选方案”，非联邦资助方负责超出最高净收益方案成本的任何项目费用。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，工程兵团进行了经济分析，得出了推荐项目备选方案的广泛货币化收益和成本范围。\n表5显示了帮助工程兵团在八项研究中选择推荐方案的货币化收益和成本信息。\n项目年化收益从约50万美元到2.106亿美元不等，项目年化成本从约100万美元到6500万美元不等，年化净收益估算从约-50万美元到1.46亿美元不等。\n在我们审查的八项研究中，有五项研究工程兵团主要依据收益和成本经济分析的结果，按照《规划指南》从备选方案中推荐了净收益最大的方案。\n这五项研究分别是纽约、檀香山、萨克拉门托、纳什维尔和堪萨斯城工程兵团辖区的研究。\n我们审查的八项研究中有三项依据《规划指南》允许的其他分析，以解决不同的项目目标或当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n工程兵团官员表示，他们在需要时依赖其他分析，以确定最佳项目设计、协助决策或响应当地非联邦资助方的偏好。\n具体而言：芝加哥区。\n芝加哥区根据两个独立的分析推荐了一个项目。\n具体而言，项目团队根据洪水风险管理目标的经济分析以及生态系统恢复目标的单独分析推荐了一项备选方案。\n工程兵团的一份文件指出，这样做可以帮助拟议的项目同时管理洪水风险并恢复流域内的生态系统。\n此外，研究指出，推荐方案旨在最大化净收益并在两个目标之间寻求平衡。\n威尔明顿区。\n威尔明顿区的研究表明，工程兵团在获得批准后，应非联邦资助方的要求推荐了当地优选备选方案，而不是具有最大净收益的备选方案。\n推荐当地优选备选方案是为了能够纳入对潜在其他社会效应的考虑，例如生命和安全风险，以及区域经济发展，例如在建设期间和建设后创造的就业机会。\n研究指出，通过这样做，工程兵团官员回应了当地的优先事项以及北卡罗来纳州普林斯维尔未来总统委员会提供的建议。\n根据研究，工程兵团考虑了对社区凝聚力、文化和历史价值、与全国平均水平相比的当地人均和家庭收入以及经济分析中未涉及的其他因素的影响。\n旧金山区。\n旧金山区的研究表明，工程兵团基于多种目标和当地偏好的结合提出了备选方案推荐。\n推荐的备选方案的目标包括减少潮汐洪水的风险以及将生态系统恢复到潮汐湿地栖息地。\n工程兵团选择了推荐的备选方案，因为非联邦资助方希望在50年的研究期间为联邦紧急事务管理署认证提供额外的过渡栖息地和更大的洪水风险管理能力。\n具体而言，当地的偏好是将堤坝建得比具有最大净收益的方案高约3英尺，从而可能比具有最大净收益的备选方案更能降低与洪水相关的公共健康和安全风险。\n我们审查的八项研究的经济分析通常满足五个关键方法要素中的三个，并部分满足两个关键要素——效果分析和透明度。\n我们的经济分析评估方法（评估方法）确定了经济分析基准结构的五个关键方法要素。\n对于效果分析要素，工程兵团已经采取措施解决某些最佳实践，或者表明由于法律要求而限制采用其他实践。\n对于透明度要素，工程兵团官员承认可以通过审查过程改进透明度。\n根据我们的评估方法，经济分析应说明所审查的行动及其理由。\n此外，应说明分析的目标；分析范围应旨在解决该目标；分析期应足够长，以涵盖拟议行动的重要经济影响。\n我们发现，所有八项分析总体上满足了这一关键要素。\n例如，所有八项经济分析表明，审查的行动包括评估洪水风险管理的改进以解决洪水问题。\n此外，这些分析提供了具体的规划目标，例如在50年的分析期间减少相关流域的洪水风险并改善当地社区的生活质量。\n此外，所有八项分析均采用了50年的分析期来分析收益和成本——这一时期应足够长以涵盖重要的经济影响，尽管一些研究假设经济条件在此期间保持不变。\n例如，檀香山地区洪水风险管理研究的分析假设，在50年的分析期内，洪泛区的住房和商业存量不会发生变化。\n根据分析，项目区域包括未充分利用或未完全开发的地点，但对开发可能如何进行的不确定性使得难以预测可能发生的变化。\n研究承认，在50年的时间内，流域的商业和住宅构成将会发生变化，但这些变化的确切性质无法以任何确定性进行预测。\n此外，八项研究中有两项涉及多用途项目，并为生态系统恢复明确了额外的经济相关目标。\n例如，旧金山区可行性研究的分析表明，该研究旨在评估和比较各种减少洪水风险和提供南旧金山湾生态系统恢复措施的经济合理性和成本效益。\n类似地，芝加哥区的研究表明，在制定生态系统恢复计划时，评估了整个流域的未开发土地，以确定是否可以在该地点进行具有成本效益的水生生态系统恢复，以及哪些措施可以提供每单位栖息地产出最低的增量成本。", "reference_summary": "The Corps, among other things, constructs flood risk management projects to reduce flood damage in threatened communities nationwide in collaboration with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps prepares feasibility studies to inform decision makers whether a proposed project warrants federal investment. In the studies, the Corps formulates and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project's objectives and assesses whether the benefits of constructing it outweigh its costs. GAO was asked to review the methodology the Corps used in feasibility studies. This report examines, for 2015 through 2017, (1) the Corps' process for identifying and evaluating the benefits, costs, and effects of project alternatives; (2) the analyses the Corps used to recommend projects; and (3) the extent to which the Corps' economic analyses of benefits and costs are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed Corps guidance; examined planning documents and economic analyses in flood risk studies that the Corps had most recently completed from 2015 through 2017 from eight districts; and compared the Corps' economic analyses with best practices in GAO's Assessment Methodology. In the eight flood risk management feasibility studies GAO reviewed (see figure), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) followed a six-step planning process consistent with its guidance to, among other things, identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of alternative plans for proposed projects. In doing so, the Corps used economic analyses to evaluate project-specific categories of potential monetary benefits and costs of alternative plans, such as flood damage reduction benefits and project construction costs. The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities. In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request. The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used. Corps officials acknowledged that transparency could be improved through their review process. By having future analyses align with transparency best practices, the Corps can better inform decision makers about potential economic effects of flood risk projects. GAO recommends that the Corps strengthen its feasibility study review process by including steps to ensure consistency with transparency best practices.

Amber Anderson, 27, has since been relieved of her duties at Christian Life Academy in Baton Rouge. She was booked into prison on Tuesday and is facing a charge of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. Anderson had been a math teacher at the school for three years and the alleged relationship took place during July and August of 2013. Amber Anderson, 27, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old freshman two years ago has admitted to the relationship and apologized for 'taking the victim's innocence' The incident has only now come to light after a former student told the victim's mother, reports WAFB. The woman confronted her son who admitted to the relationship and told detectives that he and Anderson had exchanged sexually explicit text messages and later allegedly had sex at her home. According to the probable cause affidavit, the pair began texting each other after he got her phone number from another student. The victim told police that as time progressed, 'he and [Anderson] became extremely close to one another, and the messages began to become sexual in nature.' The victim and Anderson then began to exchange nude photos of each other and began having sex in July 2013. He would walk to a fast food restaurant near his house and Anderson would pick him up. She would take him to her house where they would have sex. The victim told police this happened multiple times in July and August of 2013 until his mom found out they had been exchanging text messages. He had deleted most of them, so the affidavit says she wasn't aware of the 'intimate nature of he and the accused's relationship.' According to Christian Life Academy's website Anderson began teaching at the school in 2012, is from Laurel, Miss., and attended Mississippi State University . Concerned over what she had seen, the mother confronted Anderson and told her to stop texting her son. The mother also reported the texts to the school's administration. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint. 'I do not know anything about this. This is the first day that I have heard anything of this nature,' he told WAFB. 'We would have taken care of it then and she would no longer have been working for us that day I heard.' Police have checked the boy's cell phone records from the time of the alleged affair and found most of the calls and text messages happened between June and August 2013 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint . While being questioned by deputies, Anderson admitted to being involved in an intimate relationship with the victim, according to court documents.

PLS typically presents with skin lesions that develop concurrently with oral symptoms, with additional cases linked to seasonal variations and consanguineous marriages.

stage disease ( stage d )     [ 18 , 23 ] ,\ncurrent hf guidelines define patients in stage a as those at increased risk for hf without evidence of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf     .\nstage a represents a critically important group because many of the risk factors including hypertension can be effectively controlled and by doing so may prevent development of cardiovascular diseases including hf .\npatients are in stage b when they present with evidence of structural heart disease but without current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage c is recognized by the presence of structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage d patients are those who have refractory heart failure requiring frequent hospitalization and specialized interventions .\nseveral studies have shown the efficacy of treatment of hypertension in preventing hf [ 2427 ] .\ntreatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of hf by about 50% .   in recent years\n, significant advances have been made in increasing awareness , treatment , and control of blood pressure .\nseveral large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure     [ 2834 ] . in the most recent guidelines      for the diagnosis and management of hf in adults , the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf)/american heart association ( aha ) recognized the need for specific recommendations for special population .\nlifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure , increase drug efficacy , and decrease cardiovascular risk .\nlong -

risk population .  \nthe african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) was the first heart failure large trial to focus specifically on the african - american population and evidence represented approximately 50% of all african americans ever studied in heart failure trials     .  \nthis is randomized placebo - controlled double blind study of fixed dose isosorbide dinitrate / hydralazine ( isbd / hyd ) ( figure 2 ) . in an effort to summarize efficacy of available treatments , psaty et al\nthe database included 192,478 patients from 42 trials randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo .\nlow - dose diuretics proved the most effective first - line treatment for preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality including hf .\nthe allhat trial showed that diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers or acei in preventing cardiovascular disease outcomes including hf .\nthe allhat study also has suggested that thiazide - diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression     .  \nalthough , allhat trials and other trials showed diuretics is the first - line of antihypertensive therapy and is still the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications , this is challenged by recent studies as published in february jacc and presented in the european society of htn meetings .  \nhowever , the diuretics used in the allhat trials was chlorthalidone a long acting thiazide ( shown to effectively lower bp and improve survival ) , not really the same as hydrochlorothiazide ( hctz ) which is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive thiazide at a dose of 12.525  mg .  \n( st luke roosevelt hospital , new york , ny ) , published the analysis of 18 trials on   hctz where the antihypertensive effect of hctz at the dose that is most often used12.5 to 25  mg a day  is consistently inferior to that of most other antihypertensive drug .\nthe other limitation of diuretics as first line therapy in african americans is not only not adequate but also , has multiple side effects like dm , electrolyte abnormalities and urecemia , to mention a few .  \nhowever , there is still a role of diuretics in combination with neurohormonal ( renin angiotensin aldosterone axis ) blockade and when there is compelling indication .   according to the recent consensus statement of the international society on hypertension in blacks ( ishb ) , chlorthalidone\nfurthermore , the ishb consensus statement reinforces , patient above goal bp ( sbp / dbp15/10 ) with ( goal bp < 130/80 ) end organ damage ( hf , lvh , kidney disease ) or without end organ damage ( goal bp < 135/85 ) should be on at least on combination pharmacotherapy .\nuse of beta blockers ( bb ) as treatment for hypertension has come under scrutiny .\nconducted a meta - analysis of 13 trials , which included 105,951 patients showing that atenolol did not improve outcomes in terms of stroke and cardiovascular events .\nin stage b chf ( nyha class i ) , defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) < 40 percent in otherwise asymptomatic individuals , aceis and bbs are recommended .\niii ) manifest left ventricular dysfunction and overt symptoms ; in these individuals , aceis and bbs are also indicated .\nbbs are also recommended in hf because of clinical studies demonstrating decreased morbidity and mortality , and improvement in hf symptoms .\naldosterone antagonists may provide additional benefit in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction , usually late stage c ( nyha class iii \nlow - dose spironolactone ( 12.525  mg daily ) , when added to standard therapy , decreased mortality by 34 percent     . in the eplerenone postacute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study ( ephesus ) ,\neplerenone reduced mortality by 15% in patients following a recent mi with lvef < 40% , 90% of whom had hf symptoms     .  \npatients were excluded who had a serum creatinine of < 2.5  mg / dl and hyperkalemia .        \nthe v - heft i and ii are a large - scale trial that compared different vasodilators with placebo and among themselves .  \nv - heft i showed , the mortality rate was significantly lower for the total cohort ( african americans and whites ) in isdn / hyd arm compared to patients treated with prazosin or placebo added to digitalis and diuretics ( figure 1 )     .    in v - heft ii , though isbd / hyd was statistically inferior to enalapril in effect on mortality , patients taking isbd / hyd experienced similar mortality rate in   patients taking isbd / hyd in   v - heft - ii   as those in v - heft - i taking isbd / hyd .  \nposthoc analysis of v - heft i showed isbd / hyd significantly reduced mortality in african american patients but not in white patients .  \nthe reanalysis of v - heft ii , demonstrated the annual mortality rate african american ( 12.9 ) patients receiving isbd / hyd was 12.9% compared with 12.8% for african americans receiving enalapril .  \ndue to difference in outcomes in african americans in v - heft , the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) definitive study was designed .  \nthe a - heft was terminated earlier than anticipated completion date due to a significant ( 43% ) reduction in mortality in patients receiving combination ( isdn / hyd ) compared to the placebo arm .    adding the combination of a fixed - dose of isdn / hyd ( 20  mg/37.5  mg ) to a standard medical regimen for hf , including acei and bbs ,\nis recommended in order to improve outcomes for patients self - described as african americans , with nyha functional class iii or iv chf     .  \nfurthermore , genomic evidence from the grahf ( genetic risk assessment of heart failure in african americans ) arm of the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) showed that blacks with the more common tt phenotype ( 61% ) of the aldosterone synthase gene ( cyp11b2 ) showed greater responsiveness to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine     . the vast majority of blacks will have no identified cause for their htn     .\npast studies elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms have shown conflicting information and further investigations exploring the complex relationships and interactions are warranted     .\nthere are , however , several secondary forms of htn in blacks that are prominent and preventable .\nwe will focus on the most common , preventable and treatable secondary form of hypertension ,   obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ) .\nthe prevalence of osa in hypertensive populations is estimated to range between ( 3040% )   and in heart failure at 53% ; apnea - hypopnea index ( ahi ) 10/h )     .\nit is an independent risk factor for htn , nondipping of blood pressure and increased bp variability   and follows a dose - dependent relationship .\na prospective study showed that the odds of developing hypertension over 48 years was 2.89 times more likely for participants who had ahi  15/h compared to ahi  0 , independent of known confounders .  \ncross - sectional data has shown 2.38-times increased likelihood of having heart failure in association with osa , independent of confounders ( n = 6424 ) [ 67 , 68 ] .\nosa has been shown to act through various mechanisms , independent of blood pressure , in promoting left - ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy , diastolic     , and systolic      dysfunction , and overt heart failure .\nthese mechanisms include the hemodynamic consequences of repetitive increases in left - ventricular transmutable wall pressure and over time impaired vigil heart rate modulation leading to lv hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling .\nadditionally , osa patients without overt heart failure have more impaired diastolic relaxation than those without osa .\nemerging evidence illustrates patients with osa have more active atherosclerotic disease with a greater degree of vessel involvement and more vulnerable plaques than do patients without the disease , resulting in greater cardiovascular burden .\nthe definite treatment for osa , long - term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) therapy , has shown to suppress sympathetic activity     , lower blood pressure , reduce right ventricular volume     , and improve systolic function in patients with hf     .\nsystematic reviews , meta - analyses , and randomized controlled trials have shown statistically significant net reduction in blood pressure with cpap , especially in patients with increased ahi events     [ 7883 ] . a recent 3-year study ( n = 340 ) by durn - cantolla et al . reported that participants assigned to cpap therapy for 3 months had mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure decreased by 2.1  mmhg ( 0.4 to 3.7 ) mmhg ( p = .01 ) for systolic and 1.3 ( 0.2 to 2.3 ) mm  hg ( p = .02 ) for diastolic blood pressures     .\nsimilar evidence from randomized trials showed up to 9% increase in lvef      and increased quality of life ( qol ) and functional capacity among patients treated with 13 months of cpap therapy     .\nfurthermore , among patients with no overt failure , cpap therapy has been shown to reverse impaired diastolic relaxation .\nthere is a need for further randomized clinical trials with cpap therapy among high - risk ethnic minorities especially blacks to assess whether treatment of osa has similar long - term effects and to evaluate the effect on htn and hf morbidity and mortality .\ntaking into consideration , lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions , our changing health care community needs to emphasize the essential nature of the patient - provider relationship and establish trust and collaboration . in the past , this has been accomplished through physician , patients , family member , and other caretaker awareness , increased education of both provider and patients , and establishment of community outreach programs .\nthese measures have contributed to an increase in compliance and a reduction in the risk of hospitalizations [ 23 , 87 ] .\nwe recommend an additional emphasis on the implementation of specialty care in patients with heart failure in collaboration with the primary care provider .\nthe dramatic improvement in the management of hf and hypertension over the last 50 years has allowed us to start to target specific populations and provide more evidence - based treatment that will lead to an improvement in mortality .  \nthere are disparities in the prevalence , treatment , and control of hypertension and the incidence and morbidity and mortality of heart failure between blacks , a diverse and heterogeneous population , and whites .  \nthe management team needs to take into consideration new evidence and develop tailored strategies for effective treatment , especially for hypertension , one of the main causes of hf and many other cardiovascular complications in african africans .", "reference_summary": "hypertension ( htn ) is the most common co -

risk population .  \nthe african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) was the first heart failure large trial to focus specifically on the african - american population and evidence represented approximately 50% of all african americans ever studied in heart failure trials     .  \nthis is randomized placebo - controlled double blind study of fixed dose isosorbide dinitrate / hydralazine ( isbd / hyd ) ( figure 2 ) . in an effort to summarize efficacy of available treatments , psaty et al\nthe database included 192,478 patients from 42 trials randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo .\nlow -

diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression     .  \nalthough , allhat trials and other trials showed diuretics is the first - line of antihypertensive therapy and is still the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications , this is challenged by recent studies as published in february jacc and presented in the european society of htn meetings .  \nhowever , the diuretics used in the allhat trials was chlorthalidone a long acting thiazide ( shown to effectively lower bp and improve survival ) , not really the same as hydrochlorothiazide ( hctz ) which is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive thiazide at a dose of 12.525  mg .  \n( st luke roosevelt hospital , new york , ny ) , published the analysis of 18 trials on   hctz where the antihypertensive effect of hctz at the dose that is most often used12.5 to 25  mg a day  is consistently inferior to that of most other antihypertensive drug .\nthe other limitation of diuretics as first line therapy in african americans is not only not adequate but also , has multiple side effects like dm , electrolyte abnormalities and urecemia , to mention a few .  \nhowever , there is still a role of diuretics in combination with neurohormonal ( renin angiotensin aldosterone axis ) blockade and when there is compelling indication .   according to the recent consensus statement of the international society on hypertension in blacks ( ishb ) , chlorthalidone\nfurthermore , the ishb consensus statement reinforces , patient above goal bp ( sbp / dbp15/10 ) with ( goal bp < 130/80 ) end organ damage ( hf , lvh , kidney disease ) or without end organ damage ( goal bp < 135/85 ) should be on at least on combination pharmacotherapy .\nuse of beta blockers ( bb ) as treatment for hypertension has come under scrutiny .\nconducted a meta -

heft ii , demonstrated the annual mortality rate african american ( 12.9 ) patients receiving isbd / hyd was 12.9% compared with 12.8% for african americans receiving enalapril .  \ndue to difference in outcomes in african americans in v - heft , the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) definitive study was designed .  \nthe a - heft was terminated earlier than anticipated completion date due to a significant ( 43% ) reduction in mortality in patients receiving combination ( isdn / hyd ) compared to the placebo arm .    adding the combination of a fixed -

sectional data has shown 2.38-times increased likelihood of having heart failure in association with osa , independent of confounders ( n = 6424 ) [ 67 , 68 ] .\nosa has been shown to act through various mechanisms , independent of blood pressure , in promoting left - ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy , diastolic     , and systolic      dysfunction , and overt heart failure .\nthese mechanisms include the hemodynamic consequences of repetitive increases in left - ventricular transmutable wall pressure and over time impaired vigil heart rate modulation leading to lv hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling .\nadditionally , osa patients without overt heart failure have more impaired diastolic relaxation than those without osa .\nemerging evidence illustrates patients with osa have more active atherosclerotic disease with a greater degree of vessel involvement and more vulnerable plaques than do patients without the disease , resulting in greater cardiovascular burden .\nthe definite treatment for osa , long - term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) therapy , has shown to suppress sympathetic activity     , lower blood pressure , reduce right ventricular volume     , and improve systolic function in patients with hf     .\nsystematic reviews , meta - analyses , and randomized controlled trials have shown statistically significant net reduction in blood pressure with cpap , especially in patients with increased ahi events     [ 7883 ] . a recent 3-year study ( n = 340 ) by durn - cantolla et al . reported that participants assigned to cpap therapy for 3 months had mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure decreased by 2.1  mmhg ( 0.4 to 3.7 ) mmhg ( p = .01 ) for systolic and 1.3 ( 0.2 to 2.3 ) mm  hg ( p = .02 ) for diastolic blood pressures     .\nsimilar evidence from randomized trials showed up to 9% increase in lvef      and increased quality of life ( qol ) and functional capacity among patients treated with 13 months of cpap therapy     .\nfurthermore , among patients with no overt failure , cpap therapy has been shown to reverse impaired diastolic relaxation .\nthere is a need for further randomized clinical trials with cpap therapy among high - risk ethnic minorities especially blacks to assess whether treatment of osa has similar long - term effects and to evaluate the effect on htn and hf morbidity and mortality .\ntaking into consideration , lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions , our changing health care community needs to emphasize the essential nature of the patient - provider relationship and establish trust and collaboration . in the past , this has been accomplished through physician , patients , family member , and other caretaker awareness , increased education of both provider and patients , and establishment of community outreach programs .\nthese measures have contributed to an increase in compliance and a reduction in the risk of hospitalizations [ 23 , 87 ] .\nwe recommend an additional emphasis on the implementation of specialty care in patients with heart failure in collaboration with the primary care provider .\nthe dramatic improvement in the management of hf and hypertension over the last 50 years has allowed us to start to target specific populations and provide more evidence - based treatment that will lead to an improvement in mortality .  \nthere are disparities in the prevalence , treatment , and control of hypertension and the incidence and morbidity and mortality of heart failure between blacks , a diverse and heterogeneous population , and whites .  \nthe management team needs to take into consideration new evidence and develop tailored strategies for effective treatment , especially for hypertension , one of the main causes of hf and many other cardiovascular complications in african africans .", "reference_summary": "hypertension ( htn ) is the most common co -

) arm of the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) showed that blacks with the more common tt phenotype ( 61% ) of the aldosterone synthase gene ( cyp11b2 ) showed greater responsiveness to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine     . the vast majority of blacks will have no identified cause for their htn     .\npast studies elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms have shown conflicting information and further investigations exploring the complex relationships and interactions are warranted     .\nthere are , however , several secondary forms of htn in blacks that are prominent and preventable .\nwe will focus on the most common , preventable and treatable secondary form of hypertension ,   obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ) .\nthe prevalence of osa

association with osa , independent of confounders ( n = 6424 ) [ 67 , 68 ] .\nosa has been shown to act through various mechanisms , independent of blood pressure , in promoting left - ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy , diastolic     , and systolic      dysfunction , and overt heart failure .\nthese mechanisms include the hemodynamic consequences of repetitive increases in left - ventricular transmutable wall pressure and over time impaired vigil heart rate modulation leading to lv hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling .\nadditionally , osa patients without overt heart failure have more impaired diastolic relaxation than those without osa .\nemerging evidence illustrates patients with osa have more active atherosclerotic disease with a greater degree of vessel involvement and more vulnerable plaques than do patients without the disease , resulting in greater cardiovascular burden .\nthe definite treatment for osa , long - term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) therapy , has shown to suppress sympathetic activity     , lower blood pressure , reduce right ventricular volume     , and improve systolic function in patients with hf     .\nsystematic reviews , meta - analyses , and randomized controlled trials have shown statistically significant net reduction in blood pressure with cpap , especially in patients with increased ahi events     [ 7883 ] . a recent 3-year study ( n = 340 ) by durn - cantolla et al . reported that participants assigned to cpap therapy for 3 months had mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure decreased by 2.1  mmhg ( 0.4 to 3.7 ) mmhg ( p = .01 ) for systolic and 1.3 ( 0.2 to 2.3 ) mm  hg ( p = .02 ) for diastolic blood pressures     .\nsimilar evidence from randomized trials showed up to 9% increase in lvef      and increased quality of life ( qol ) and functional capacity among patients treated with 13 months of cpap therapy     .\nfurthermore , among patients with no overt failure , cpap therapy has been shown to reverse impaired diastolic relaxation .\nthere is a need for further randomized clinical trials with cpap therapy among high - risk ethnic minorities especially blacks to assess whether treatment of osa has similar long - term effects and to evaluate the effect on htn and hf morbidity and mortality .\ntaking into consideration , lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions , our changing health care community needs to emphasize the essential nature of the patient - provider relationship and establish trust and collaboration . in the past , this has been accomplished through physician , patients , family member , and other caretaker awareness , increased education of both provider and patients , and establishment of community outreach programs .\nthese measures have contributed to an increase in compliance and a reduction in the risk of hospitalizations [ 23 , 87 ] .\nwe recommend an additional emphasis on the implementation of specialty care in patients with heart failure in collaboration with the primary care provider .\nthe dramatic improvement in the management of hf and hypertension over the last 50 years has allowed us to start to target specific populations and provide more evidence - based treatment that will lead to an improvement in mortality .  \nthere are disparities in the prevalence , treatment , and control of hypertension and the incidence and morbidity and mortality of heart failure between blacks , a diverse and heterogeneous population , and whites .  \nthe management team needs to take into consideration new evidence and

stage disease ( stage d )     [ 18 , 23 ] ,\ncurrent hf guidelines define patients in stage a as those at increased risk for hf without evidence of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf     .\nstage a represents a critically important group because many of the risk factors including hypertension can be effectively controlled and by doing so may prevent development of cardiovascular diseases including hf .\npatients are in stage b when they present with evidence of structural heart disease but without current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage c is recognized by the presence of structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage d patients are those who have refractory heart failure requiring frequent hospitalization and specialized interventions .\nseveral studies have shown the efficacy of treatment of hypertension in preventing hf [ 2427 ] .\ntreatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of hf by about 50% .   in recent years\n, significant advances have been made in increasing awareness , treatment , and control of blood pressure .\nseveral large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure     [ 2834 ] . in the most recent guidelines      for the diagnosis and management of hf in adults , the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf)/american heart association ( aha ) recognized the need for specific recommendations for special population .\nlifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure , increase drug efficacy , and decrease cardiovascular risk .\nlong -

risk ethnic minority groups especially blacks who are disproportionately burdened should be developed .   among racial groups ,\nafrican - american adults have the highest rates ( 44% ) of hypertension in the world      and are more resistant      to treatment .  \nin particular , black women have the highest prevalence      and the lowest blood pressure control     .  \nthe relative incidence of hf is 50% higher in african americans , 3% of whom have hf , compared with 2% of the general population     [ 13 , 14 ] .  \nthe disease occurs at an earlier age , and usually at a more advanced stage   along with increased hospitalization   and mortality .\nother causes of hf include coronary artery disease , valvular heart disease , diabetes , left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathies .  \novert clinical hf resulting from diastolic left ventricular dysfunction may be clinically indistinguishable from that resulting from systolic dysfunction\n. hf with preserved left ventricular function is observed in 30% to 50% of adult cases of hf .\ncoronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is a principal cause of systolic left ventricular dysfunction followed by hypertension .\na variety of neurohormonal systems , especially the renin - angiotensin aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems are activated in response to the left ventricular dysfunction and such activation leads to abnormal ventricular remodeling . the inexorable progression to more severe stages of left ventricular dysfunction\ncan be significantly reduced by effective therapy with neurohormonal blockade including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) , beta blockers ( bbs ) , and aldosterone antagonists     .\ncurrent understanding of the pathophysiology of hf has revolved around neurohormonal activation     [ 19 , 20 ] .  \nthis endothelial dysfunction may result from insufficient nitric oxide ( no ) secondary to either reduced endothelial production of no or to increase no inactivation [ 17 , 19 , 21 ] . in hf , a pronounced increase in angiotensin ii , with modestly reduced no is seen among whites . however , african americans with hf may exhibit greater no reduction ; conversely , angiotensin ii might be less elevated among whites .\nimportant studies are investigating gene variation among the races that may influence the risk of developing hypertension and its complications , such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding for 1-adrenergic receptors and a2c - adrenergic receptors .\nafrican americans who are homozygous for polymorphisms in both the 1-adrenergic and a2c - adrenergic receptor genes are at a 10-fold greater risk for heart failure , which is overexpressed in african - americans .  \ngroups with overexpression of transforming growth factor -1 ( tgf-1 ) , a cytokine involved in cardiac fibrosis and remodeling , vascular and renal disease , production of the vasoconstrictor , endothelin-1 , and stimulation of renin release , have a worse prognosis .\nother genetic polymorphisms in african americans that may influence heart failure risk include elevated production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , aldosterone synthase , and the g protein 825-t allele .\n  there are two major approaches to classifying the patient 's hf stage or clinical severity .  \nthe most common is the new york heart association ( nyha ) classification , mainly based on functional capacity and subjective level of symptoms severity .  \nthis scheme is fluid and its class fluctuates in the same patient depending on their subjective assessment and clinical status .\nthe other approach , adopted by the american college of cardiology / american heart association ( acc / aha ) guidelines , emphasizes disease progression\n.   classified as stages a , b , c , and d , each of these stages has definable characteristics and recommended interventions . to emphasize the progressive nature of hf and the need to prevent its development or progression to end - stage disease ( stage d )     [ 18 , 23 ] ,\ncurrent hf guidelines define patients in stage a as those at increased risk for hf without evidence of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf     .\nstage a represents a critically important group because many of the risk factors including hypertension can be effectively controlled and by doing so may prevent development of cardiovascular diseases including hf .\npatients are in stage b when they present with evidence of structural heart disease but without current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage c is recognized by the presence of structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage d patients are those who have refractory heart failure requiring frequent hospitalization and specialized interventions .\nseveral studies have shown the efficacy of treatment of hypertension in preventing hf [ 2427 ] .\ntreatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of hf by about 50% .   in recent years\n, significant advances have been made in increasing awareness , treatment , and control of blood pressure .\nseveral large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure     [ 2834 ] . in the most recent guidelines      for the diagnosis and management of hf in adults , the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf)/american heart association ( aha ) recognized the need for specific recommendations for special population .\nlifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure , increase drug efficacy , and decrease cardiovascular risk .\nlong - term primary prevention of hypertension includes weight reduction in overweight / obese individuals .\nweight loss intervention was associated with a 21% reduction in the incidence of hypertension over a 36-month period     .\ndietary practices , reducing intake of dietary sodium to < 1.5  g nacl [ 3 , 36 ] , low potassium , magnesium , and saturated fat intake , increased calcium intake     , decreased consumption of alcohol , have demonstrated greater bp reduction in blacks    \n. these practices are most successful when reinforced with comprehensive education and counseling     [ 39 , 40 ] .\nexercise training , regular aerobic physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day most days , has been shown to reduce recurrent cardiac events in patients with lv dysfunction from ischemic heart disease and is recommended under close medical supervision . culturally cognizant and sensitive modalities should be implemented to help guide improved compliance of therapeutic lifestyle changes ( tlc ) in special populations     [ 43 , 44 ] . despite lifestyle modifications ,\nmost patients with hypertension need pharmacologic therapy for better bp control . in the united states ,\npharmacological treatment of hypertension before development of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf is mainly based on studies looking at prevention of end - organ damage .\nspecific classes of medication are recommended for patients in stages b - d that have shown benefit in reducing mortality and number of hospitalizations .\nthe reader should refer to the major guidelines for full treatment recommendations of hf in the general population     [ 18 , 23 , 46 ] .\n.   however , ethnic minorities who are at greater risk for developing hf remain underrepresented in most clinical trials .   according to a recent paper by mitchell et al . \ntreatment of hf in african americans  a call to action  , most of the available evidence is based on limited representation of african americans in these trials or posthoc analysis of limited evidence .\nthese papers once again summarize the available evidence in hf management in african americans and call for more therapeutic trial focused in these high - risk population .  \nthe african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) was the first heart failure large trial to focus specifically on the african - american population and evidence represented approximately 50% of all african americans ever studied in heart failure trials     .  \nthis is randomized placebo - controlled double blind study of fixed dose isosorbide dinitrate / hydralazine ( isbd / hyd ) ( figure 2 ) . in an effort to summarize efficacy of available treatments , psaty et al\nthe database included 192,478 patients from 42 trials randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo .\nlow - dose diuretics proved the most effective first - line treatment for preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality including hf .\nthe allhat trial showed that diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers or acei in preventing cardiovascular disease outcomes including hf .\nthe allhat study also has suggested that thiazide - diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression     .  \nalthough , allhat trials and other trials showed diuretics is the first - line of antihypertensive therapy and is still the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications , this is challenged by recent studies as published in february jacc and presented in the european society of htn meetings .  \nhowever , the diuretics used in the allhat trials was chlorthalidone a long acting thiazide ( shown to effectively lower bp and improve survival ) , not really the same as hydrochlorothiazide ( hctz ) which is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive thiazide at a dose of 12.525  mg .  \n( st luke roosevelt hospital , new york , ny ) , published the analysis of 18 trials on   hctz where the antihypertensive effect of hctz at the dose that is most often used12.5 to 25  mg a day  is consistently inferior to that of most other antihypertensive drug .\nthe other limitation of diuretics as first line therapy in african americans is not only not adequate but also , has multiple side effects like dm , electrolyte abnormalities and urecemia , to mention a few .  \nhowever , there is still a role of diuretics in combination with neurohormonal ( renin angiotensin aldosterone axis ) blockade and when there is compelling indication .   according to the recent consensus statement of the international society on hypertension in blacks ( ishb ) , chlorthalidone\nfurthermore , the ishb consensus statement reinforces , patient above goal bp ( sbp / dbp15/10 ) with ( goal bp < 130/80 ) end organ damage ( hf , lvh , kidney disease ) or without end organ damage ( goal bp < 135/85 ) should be on at least on combination pharmacotherapy .\nuse of beta blockers ( bb ) as treatment for hypertension has come under scrutiny .\nconducted a meta - analysis of 13 trials , which included 105,951 patients showing that atenolol did not improve outcomes in terms of stroke and cardiovascular events .\nin stage b chf ( nyha class i ) , defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) < 40 percent in otherwise asymptomatic individuals , aceis and bbs are recommended .\niii ) manifest left ventricular dysfunction and overt symptoms ; in these individuals , aceis and bbs are also indicated .\nbbs are also recommended in hf because of clinical studies demonstrating decreased morbidity and mortality , and improvement in hf symptoms .\naldosterone antagonists may provide additional benefit in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction , usually late stage c ( nyha class iii \nlow - dose spironolactone ( 12.525  mg daily ) , when added to standard therapy , decreased mortality by 34 percent     . in the eplerenone postacute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study ( ephesus ) ,\neplerenone reduced mortality by 15% in patients following a recent mi with lvef < 40% , 90% of whom had hf symptoms     .  \npatients were excluded who had a serum creatinine of < 2.5  mg / dl and hyperkalemia .        \nthe v - heft i and ii are a large - scale trial that compared different vasodilators with placebo and among themselves .  \nv - heft i showed , the mortality rate was significantly lower for the total cohort ( african americans and whites ) in isdn / hyd arm compared to patients treated with prazosin or placebo added to digitalis and diuretics ( figure 1 )     .    in v - heft ii , though isbd / hyd was statistically inferior to enalapril in effect on mortality , patients taking isbd / hyd experienced similar mortality rate in   patients taking isbd / hyd in   v - heft - ii   as those in v - heft - i taking isbd / hyd .  \nposthoc analysis of v - heft i showed isbd / hyd significantly reduced mortality in african american patients but not in white patients .  \nthe reanalysis of v - heft ii , demonstrated the annual mortality rate african american ( 12.9 ) patients receiving isbd / hyd was 12.9% compared with 12.8% for african americans receiving enalapril .  \ndue to difference in outcomes in african americans in v - heft , the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) definitive study was designed .  \nthe a - heft was terminated earlier than anticipated completion date due to a significant ( 43% ) reduction in mortality in patients receiving combination ( isdn / hyd ) compared to the placebo arm .    adding the combination of a fixed - dose of isdn / hyd ( 20  mg/37.5  mg ) to a standard medical regimen for hf , including acei and bbs ,\nis recommended in order to improve outcomes for patients self - described as african americans , with nyha functional class iii or iv chf     .  \nfurthermore , genomic evidence from the grahf ( genetic risk assessment of heart failure in african americans ) arm of the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) showed that blacks with the more common tt phenotype ( 61% ) of the aldosterone synthase gene ( cyp11b2 ) showed greater responsiveness to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine     . the vast majority of blacks will have no identified cause for their htn     .\npast studies elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms have shown conflicting information and further investigations exploring the complex relationships and interactions are warranted     .\nthere are , however , several secondary forms of htn in blacks that are prominent and preventable .\nwe will focus on the most common , preventable and treatable secondary form of hypertension ,   obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ) .\nthe prevalence of osa in hypertensive populations is estimated to range between ( 3040% )   and in heart failure at 53% ; apnea -

stage disease ( stage d )     [ 18 , 23 ] ,\ncurrent hf guidelines define patients in stage a as those at increased risk for hf without evidence of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf     .\nstage a represents a critically important group because many of the risk factors including hypertension can be effectively controlled and by doing so may prevent development of cardiovascular diseases including hf .\npatients are in stage b when they present with evidence of structural heart disease but without current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage c is recognized by the presence of structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage d patients are those who have refractory heart failure requiring frequent hospitalization and specialized interventions .\nseveral studies have shown the efficacy of treatment of hypertension in preventing hf [ 2427 ] .\ntreatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of hf by about 50% .   in recent years\n, significant advances have been made in increasing awareness , treatment , and control of blood pressure .\nseveral large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure     [ 2834 ] . in the most recent guidelines      for the diagnosis and management of hf in adults , the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf)/american heart association ( aha ) recognized the need for specific recommendations for special population .\nlifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure , increase drug efficacy , and decrease cardiovascular risk .\nlong -

risk population .  \nthe african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) was the first heart failure large trial to focus specifically on the african - american population and evidence represented approximately 50% of all african americans ever studied in heart failure trials     .  \nthis is randomized placebo - controlled double blind study of fixed dose isosorbide dinitrate / hydralazine ( isbd / hyd ) ( figure 2 ) . in an effort to summarize efficacy of available treatments , psaty et al\nthe database included 192,478 patients from 42 trials randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo .\nlow - dose diuretics proved the most effective first - line treatment for preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality including hf .\nthe allhat trial showed that diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers or acei in preventing cardiovascular disease outcomes including hf .\nthe allhat study also has suggested that thiazide - diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression     .  \nalthough , allhat trials and other trials showed diuretics is the first - line of antihypertensive therapy and is still the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications , this is challenged by recent studies as published in february jacc and presented in the european society of htn meetings .  \nhowever , the diuretics used in the allhat trials was chlorthalidone a long acting thiazide ( shown to effectively lower bp and improve survival ) , not really the same as hydrochlorothiazide ( hctz ) which is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive thiazide at a dose of 12.525  mg .  \n( st luke roosevelt hospital , new york , ny ) , published the analysis of 18 trials on   hctz where the antihypertensive effect of hctz at the dose that is most often used12.5 to 25  mg a day  is consistently inferior to that of most other antihypertensive drug .\nthe other limitation of diuretics as first line therapy in african americans is not only not adequate but also , has multiple side effects like dm , electrolyte abnormalities and urecemia , to mention a few .  \nhowever , there is still a role of diuretics in combination with neurohormonal ( renin angiotensin aldosterone axis ) blockade and when there is compelling indication .   according to the recent consensus statement of the international society on hypertension in blacks ( ishb ) , chlorthalidone\nfurthermore , the ishb consensus statement reinforces , patient above goal bp ( sbp / dbp15/10 ) with ( goal bp < 130/80 ) end organ damage ( hf , lvh , kidney disease ) or without end organ damage ( goal bp < 135/85 ) should be on at least on combination pharmacotherapy .\nuse of beta blockers ( bb ) as treatment for hypertension has come under scrutiny .\nconducted a meta - analysis of 13 trials , which included 105,951 patients showing that atenolol did not improve outcomes in terms of stroke and cardiovascular events .\nin stage b chf ( nyha class i ) , defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) < 40 percent in otherwise asymptomatic individuals , aceis and bbs are recommended .\niii ) manifest left ventricular dysfunction and overt symptoms ; in these individuals , aceis and bbs are also indicated .\nbbs are also recommended in hf because of clinical studies demonstrating decreased morbidity and mortality , and improvement in hf symptoms .\naldosterone antagonists may provide additional benefit in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction , usually late stage c ( nyha class iii \nlow - dose spironolactone ( 12.525  mg daily ) , when added to standard therapy , decreased mortality by 34 percent     . in the eplerenone postacute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study ( ephesus ) ,\neplerenone reduced mortality by 15% in patients following a recent mi with lvef < 40% , 90% of whom had hf symptoms     .  \npatients were excluded who had a serum creatinine of < 2.5  mg / dl and hyperkalemia .        \nthe v - heft i and ii are a large - scale trial that compared different vasodilators with placebo and among themselves .  \nv - heft i showed , the mortality rate was significantly lower for the total cohort ( african americans and whites ) in isdn / hyd arm compared to patients treated with prazosin or placebo added to digitalis and diuretics ( figure 1 )     .    in v - heft ii , though isbd / hyd was statistically inferior to enalapril in effect on mortality , patients taking isbd / hyd experienced similar mortality rate in   patients taking isbd / hyd in   v - heft - ii   as those in v - heft - i taking isbd / hyd .  \nposthoc analysis of v - heft i showed isbd / hyd significantly reduced mortality in african american patients but not in white patients .  \nthe reanalysis of v - heft ii , demonstrated the annual mortality rate african american ( 12.9 ) patients receiving isbd / hyd was 12.9% compared with 12.8% for african americans receiving enalapril .  \ndue to difference in outcomes in african americans in v - heft , the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) definitive study was designed .  \nthe a - heft was terminated earlier than anticipated completion date due to a significant ( 43% ) reduction in mortality in patients receiving combination ( isdn / hyd ) compared to the placebo arm .    adding the combination of a fixed - dose of isdn / hyd ( 20  mg/37.5  mg ) to a standard medical regimen for hf , including acei and bbs ,\nis recommended in order to improve outcomes for patients self - described as african americans , with nyha functional class iii or iv chf     .  \nfurthermore , genomic evidence from the grahf ( genetic risk assessment of heart failure in african americans ) arm of the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) showed that blacks with the more common tt phenotype ( 61% ) of the aldosterone synthase gene ( cyp11b2 ) showed greater responsiveness to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine     . the vast majority of blacks will have no identified cause for their htn     .\npast studies elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms have shown conflicting information and further investigations exploring the complex relationships and interactions are warranted     .\nthere are , however , several secondary forms of htn in blacks that are prominent and preventable .\nwe will focus on the most common , preventable and treatable secondary form of hypertension ,   obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ) .\nthe prevalence of osa in hypertensive populations is estimated to range between ( 3040% )   and in heart failure at 53% ; apnea - hypopnea index ( ahi ) 10/h )     .\nit is an independent risk factor for htn , nondipping of blood pressure and increased bp variability   and follows a dose - dependent relationship .\na prospective study showed that the odds of developing hypertension over 48 years was 2.89 times more likely for participants who had ahi  15/h compared to ahi  0 , independent of known confounders .  \ncross - sectional data has shown 2.38-times increased likelihood of having heart failure in association with osa , independent of confounders ( n = 6424 ) [ 67 , 68 ] .\nosa has been shown to act through various mechanisms , independent of blood pressure , in promoting left - ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy , diastolic     , and systolic      dysfunction , and overt heart failure .\nthese mechanisms include the hemodynamic consequences of repetitive increases in left - ventricular transmutable wall pressure and over time impaired vigil heart rate modulation leading to lv hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling .\nadditionally , osa patients without overt heart failure have more impaired diastolic relaxation than those without osa .\nemerging evidence illustrates patients with osa have more active atherosclerotic disease with a greater degree of vessel involvement and more vulnerable plaques than do patients without the disease , resulting in greater cardiovascular burden .\nthe definite treatment for osa , long - term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) therapy , has shown to suppress sympathetic activity     , lower blood pressure , reduce right ventricular volume     , and improve systolic function in patients with hf     .\nsystematic reviews , meta - analyses , and randomized controlled trials have shown statistically significant net reduction in blood pressure with cpap , especially in patients with increased ahi events     [ 7883 ] . a recent 3-year study ( n = 340 ) by durn - cantolla et al . reported that participants assigned to cpap therapy for 3 months had mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure decreased by 2.1  mmhg ( 0.4 to 3.7 ) mmhg ( p = .01 ) for systolic and 1.3 ( 0.2 to 2.3 ) mm  hg ( p = .02 ) for diastolic blood pressures     .\nsimilar evidence from randomized trials showed up to 9% increase in lvef      and increased quality of life ( qol ) and functional capacity among patients treated with 13 months of cpap therapy     .\nfurthermore , among patients with no overt failure , cpap therapy has been shown to reverse impaired diastolic relaxation .\nthere is a need for further randomized clinical trials with cpap therapy among high - risk ethnic minorities especially blacks to assess whether treatment of osa has similar long - term effects and to evaluate the effect on htn and hf morbidity and mortality .\ntaking into consideration , lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions , our changing health care community needs to emphasize the essential nature of the patient - provider relationship and establish trust and collaboration . in the past , this has been accomplished through physician , patients , family member , and other caretaker awareness , increased education of both provider and patients , and establishment of community outreach programs .\nthese measures have contributed to an increase in compliance and a reduction in the risk of hospitalizations [ 23 , 87 ] .\nwe recommend an additional emphasis on the implementation of specialty care in patients with heart failure in collaboration with the primary care provider .\nthe dramatic improvement in the management of hf and hypertension over the last 50 years has allowed us to start to target specific populations and provide more evidence - based treatment that will lead to an improvement in mortality .  \nthere are disparities in the prevalence , treatment , and control of hypertension and the incidence and morbidity and mortality of heart failure between blacks , a diverse and heterogeneous population , and whites .  \nthe management team needs to take into consideration new evidence and develop tailored strategies for effective treatment , especially for hypertension , one of the main causes of hf and many other cardiovascular complications in african africans .", "reference_summary": "hypertension ( htn ) is the most common co -

americans .  \ngroups with overexpression of transforming growth factor -1 ( tgf-1 ) , a cytokine involved in cardiac fibrosis and remodeling , vascular and renal disease , production of the vasoconstrictor , endothelin-1 , and stimulation of renin release , have a worse prognosis .\nother genetic polymorphisms in african americans that may influence heart failure risk include elevated production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , aldosterone synthase , and the g protein 825-t allele .\n  there are two major approaches to classifying the patient 's hf stage or clinical severity .  \nthe most common is the new york heart association ( nyha ) classification , mainly based on functional capacity and subjective level of symptoms severity .  \nthis scheme is fluid and its class fluctuates in the same patient depending on their subjective assessment and clinical status .\nthe other approach , adopted by the american college of cardiology / american heart association ( acc / aha ) guidelines , emphasizes disease progression\n.   classified as stages a , b , c , and d , each of these stages has definable characteristics and recommended interventions . to emphasize the progressive nature of hf and the need to prevent its development or progression to end - stage disease ( stage d )     [ 18 , 23 ] ,\ncurrent hf guidelines define patients in stage a as those at increased risk for hf without evidence of structural heart disease or symptoms of hf     .\nstage a represents a critically important group because many of the risk factors including hypertension can be effectively controlled and by doing so may prevent development of cardiovascular diseases including hf .\npatients are in stage b when they present with evidence of structural heart disease but without current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage c is recognized by the presence of structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of hf .\nstage d patients are those who have refractory heart failure requiring frequent hospitalization and specialized interventions .\nseveral studies have shown the efficacy of treatment of hypertension in preventing hf [ 2427 ] .\ntreatment of hypertension reduces the incidence of hf by about 50% .   in recent years\n, significant advances have been made in increasing awareness , treatment , and control of blood pressure .\nseveral large , randomized clinical trials have shown that specific classes of medication have mortality benefit in patients with heart failure     [ 2834 ] . in the most recent guidelines      for the diagnosis and management of hf in adults , the american college of cardiology foundation ( accf)/american heart association ( aha ) recognized the need for specific recommendations for special population .\nlifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce blood pressure , increase drug efficacy , and decrease cardiovascular risk .\nlong -

dose diuretics proved the most effective first - line treatment for preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality including hf .\nthe allhat trial showed that diuretics are as effective as calcium channel blockers or acei in preventing cardiovascular disease outcomes including hf .\nthe allhat study also has suggested that thiazide - diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression     .  \nalthough , allhat trials and other trials showed diuretics is the first - line of antihypertensive therapy and is still the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications , this is challenged by recent studies as published in february jacc and presented in the european society of htn meetings .  \nhowever , the diuretics used in the allhat trials was chlorthalidone a long acting thiazide ( shown to effectively lower bp and improve survival ) , not really the same as hydrochlorothiazide ( hctz ) which is the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive thiazide at a dose of 12.525  mg .  \n( st luke roosevelt hospital , new york , ny ) , published the analysis of 18 trials on   hctz where the antihypertensive effect of hctz at the dose that is most often used12.5 to 25  mg a day  is consistently inferior to that of most other antihypertensive drug .\nthe other limitation of diuretics as first line therapy in african americans is not only not adequate but also , has multiple side effects like dm , electrolyte abnormalities and urecemia , to mention a few .  \nhowever , there is still a role of diuretics in combination with neurohormonal ( renin angiotensin aldosterone axis ) blockade and when there is compelling indication .   according to the recent consensus statement of the international society on hypertension in blacks ( ishb ) , chlorthalidone\nfurthermore , the ishb consensus statement reinforces , patient above goal bp ( sbp / dbp15/10 ) with ( goal bp < 130/80 ) end organ damage ( hf , lvh , kidney disease ) or without end organ damage ( goal bp < 135/85 ) should be on at least on combination pharmacotherapy .\nuse of beta blockers ( bb ) as treatment for hypertension has come under scrutiny .\nconducted a meta -

heft i and ii are a large - scale trial that compared different vasodilators with placebo and among themselves .  \nv - heft i showed , the mortality rate was significantly lower for the total cohort ( african americans and whites ) in isdn / hyd arm compared to patients treated with prazosin or placebo added to digitalis and diuretics ( figure 1 )     .    in v - heft ii , though isbd / hyd was statistically inferior to enalapril in effect on mortality , patients taking isbd / hyd experienced similar mortality rate in   patients taking isbd / hyd in   v - heft - ii   as those in v - heft - i taking isbd / hyd .  \nposthoc analysis of v - heft i showed isbd / hyd significantly reduced mortality in african american patients but not in white patients .  \nthe reanalysis of v - heft ii , demonstrated the annual mortality rate african american ( 12.9 ) patients receiving isbd / hyd was 12.9% compared with 12.8% for african americans receiving enalapril .  \ndue to difference in outcomes in african americans in v - heft , the african american heart failure trial ( a - heft ) definitive study was designed .  \nthe a - heft was terminated earlier than anticipated completion date due to a significant ( 43% ) reduction in mortality in patients receiving combination ( isdn / hyd ) compared to the placebo arm .    adding the combination of a fixed -

sectional data has shown 2.38-times increased likelihood of having heart failure in association with osa , independent of confounders ( n = 6424 ) [ 67 , 68 ] .\nosa has been shown to act through various mechanisms , independent of blood pressure , in promoting left - ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy , diastolic     , and systolic      dysfunction , and overt heart failure .\nthese mechanisms include the hemodynamic consequences of repetitive increases in left - ventricular transmutable wall pressure and over time impaired vigil heart rate modulation leading to lv hypertrophy and ventricular remodeling .\nadditionally , osa patients without overt heart failure have more impaired diastolic relaxation than those without osa .\nemerging evidence illustrates patients with osa have more active atherosclerotic disease with a greater degree of vessel involvement and more vulnerable plaques than do patients without the disease , resulting in greater cardiovascular burden .\nthe definite treatment for osa , long - term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) therapy , has shown to suppress sympathetic activity     , lower blood pressure , reduce right ventricular volume     , and improve systolic function in patients with hf     .\nsystematic reviews , meta - analyses , and randomized controlled trials have shown statistically significant net reduction in blood pressure with cpap , especially in patients with increased ahi events     [ 7883 ] . a recent 3-year study ( n = 340 ) by durn - cantolla et al . reported that participants assigned to cpap therapy for 3 months had mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure decreased by 2.1  mmhg ( 0.4 to 3.7 ) mmhg ( p = .01 ) for systolic and 1.3 ( 0.2 to 2.3 ) mm  hg ( p = .02 ) for diastolic blood pressures     .\nsimilar evidence from randomized trials showed up to 9% increase in lvef      and increased quality of life ( qol ) and functional capacity among patients treated with 13 months of cpap therapy     .\nfurthermore , among patients with no overt failure , cpap therapy has been shown to reverse impaired diastolic relaxation .\nthere is a need for further randomized clinical trials with cpap therapy among high - risk ethnic minorities especially blacks to assess whether treatment of osa has similar long - term effects and to evaluate the effect on htn and hf morbidity and mortality .\ntaking into consideration , lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions , our changing health care community needs to emphasize the essential nature of the patient - provider relationship and establish trust and collaboration . in the past , this has been accomplished through physician , patients , family member , and other caretaker awareness , increased education of both provider and patients , and establishment of community outreach programs .\nthese measures have contributed to an increase in compliance and a reduction in the risk of hospitalizations [ 23 , 87 ] .\nwe recommend an additional emphasis on the implementation of specialty care in patients with heart failure in collaboration with the primary care provider .\nthe dramatic improvement in the management of hf and hypertension over the last 50 years has allowed us to start to target specific populations and provide more evidence - based treatment that will lead to an improvement in mortality .  \nthere are disparities in the prevalence , treatment , and control of hypertension and the incidence and morbidity and mortality of heart failure between blacks , a diverse and heterogeneous population , and whites .  \nthe management team needs to take into consideration new evidence and develop tailored strategies for effective treatment , especially for hypertension , one of the main causes of hf and many other cardiovascular complications in african africans .", "reference_summary": "hypertension ( htn ) is the most common co -

It significantly contributes to cardiovascular disease and stroke, incurring billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. HTN often leads to heart failure (HF), which has a poor prognosis, with less than half of patients surviving five years post-diagnosis.  African Americans experience higher rates of HTN and HF, with worse treatment outcomes and earlier disease onset.  Genetic factors contribute to this disparity, as variations in genes encoding for adrenergic receptors increase HF risk in African Americans.  Managing HTN effectively is crucial for preventing HF. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise, can lower blood pressure.  Pharmacological interventions, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, are also essential, though optimal treatments for African Americans require further research due to underrepresentation in clinical trials. The A-HeFT trial demonstrated the efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine in reducing mortality for African Americans with advanced HF.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and treatable secondary cause of HTN, particularly in African Americans, and CPAP therapy can effectively lower blood pressure and improve heart function. Culturally sensitive approaches and strong patient-provider relationships are crucial for improving treatment adherence and outcomes.  More research is needed to develop targeted interventions for high-risk populations, especially within the diverse African American community, addressing the disparities in HTN and HF prevalence, treatment, and outcomes.", "keyfacts": ["Hypertension is the most common comorbidity worldwide.", "The U.S. prevalence of hypertension among adults aged 18 years in 2005-2008 was 30.9%.",

Special provisions of the INA authorize the naturalization of current and recently discharged service members. Qualifying military service includes active or reserve service in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, or service in a National Guard unit. A person who has served honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for 1 year during peacetime may be eligible to apply for naturalization. In addition, during designated periods of hostilities, such as World War I and World War II and the current global war on terrorism, members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve honorably in an active duty status, or as members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, are eligible to apply for naturalization without meeting any minimum required period of service. DOD determines if a service member meets the qualifying service requirement by certifying Form N-426, Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service, or by issuing Forms DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, NGB-22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service, or an equivalent discharge document. The information provided in those forms determines whether or not the service member completed all requirements for honorable service, including whether the service member served honorably and, if he or she has separated from service, whether his or her separation was under honorable conditions. In order to naturalize, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces must also meet the requirements and statutory qualifications to become a citizen. Specifically, he or she must demonstrate good moral character and have sufficient knowledge of the English language, U.S. government, and history. Additionally, an applicant must show attachment to the principles of the Constitution and favorable disposition toward the good order and happiness of the United States. However, qualified members of the U.S. Armed Forces are exempt from other naturalization requirements, including application fees and requirements for continuous residence and physical presence in the United States. DOD also has authority to expand military recruiting to certain nonimmigrants and other lawfully present aliens. Beginning in December 2008, the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program allowed certain U.S. nonimmigrant visa holders, asylees, refugees, and individuals with Temporary Protected Status to enlist in the military if they possessed medical, language, and other types of skills deemed vital for military operations. DOD ended the MAVNI program in fiscal year 2016, citing counterintelligence concerns. Between 2008 and 2016, 10,400 individuals enlisted in the U.S. military through the MAVNI program, according to DOD data. DHS is responsible for arresting, detaining, litigating charges of removability against, and removing foreign nationals who are suspected and determined to be in the United States in violation of U.S. immigration laws. Trial attorneys from ICE’s OPLA represent the U.S. government as civil prosecutors in immigration court removal proceedings. ICE’s ERO is responsible for arresting and detaining potentially removable foreign nationals pending the outcome of their immigration court cases and removing individuals subject to an immigration judge’s final order of removal. ICE’s HSI is responsible for investigating a range of domestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement of people and goods into, within, and out of the United States. Individuals may be subject to removal for a wide variety of reasons, including entering the United States illegally, staying longer than their authorized period of admission, being convicted of certain crimes, or engaging in terrorist activity. LPRs are foreign nationals under U.S. immigration law and therefore may be subject to immigration enforcement and removal from the United States for reasons such as controlled substance violations or conviction of an aggravated felony. Both HSI agents and ERO officers may encounter potentially removable individuals and are to decide whether to issue them a charging document, known as a NTA, ordering the individual to appear before an immigration judge to respond to removal charges. If the judge finds that the respondent is removable and not otherwise eligible for relief, the judge will issue an order of removal, subjecting the respondent to removal by ERO once the order is administratively final. The VA is responsible for administering benefits and services, such as health care and disability compensation, to veterans in the United States and abroad, including veterans who have been removed from the United States. VA pays monthly disability compensation to veterans for disabilities caused or aggravated by military service, known as service- connected disabilities. Veterans with service-connected disabilities may also be eligible for other VA benefits and services, such as job training. VA staff in regional offices process disability compensation claims. After a veteran submits a disability claim to VA, a VA Veterans Service Representative reviews the claim and assists the veteran with gathering relevant evidence, such as military service records, medical examinations, and treatment records from VA medical facilities and private providers. If necessary to provide support to substantiate the claim, VA will provide a medical examination, known as a Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam, to obtain evidence of the veteran’s disabilities and their connection to military service. Within the United States, medical providers who work for the Veterans Health Administration often conduct these exams. VA also contracts with private firms to perform these exams. Outside the United States, VA contracts with private firms to perform exams in 33 countries. In countries where VA contractors do not perform exams, VA coordinates with State staff at embassies and consulates to schedule exams with private providers. Once VA receives the claim evidence, a Rating Veterans Service Representative evaluates the claim and determines whether the veteran is eligible for benefits, and if so, assigns a percentage rating. After a rating is assigned, VA provides VSO staff assisting a veteran with a claim up to 48 hours to review the claim decision prior to finalizing the decision. A Veterans Service Representative then determines the amount of the award, if any, and drafts a decision notice. A senior Veterans Service Representative then reviews and authorizes the award for release to the veteran. See figure 1 for details on the 5 phases of VA’s disability compensation claims process. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, VA received over 8.9 million disability compensation claims from over 3.9 million veterans and awarded over $20.2 billion in benefits, according to VA data. ICE has developed policies that govern the handling of cases involving potentially removable veterans. When HSI agents and ERO officers learn that they have encountered a veteran, these policies require they conduct additional assessments, create additional documentation, and obtain management approval in order to proceed with the case. Specifically, in June 2004, ICE’s Acting Director of Investigations issued a memo giving the HSI Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in each field office the authority to approve issuance of a NTA in cases involving current service members or veterans. Similarly, in September 2004, ICE’s Acting Director of Detention and Removal Operations issued a memo giving the ERO Field Office Director (FOD) in each field office the authority to approve issuance of a NTA in cases involving current service members or veterans. In order to issue a NTA to a veteran, the SAC and FOD must consider, at a minimum, the veteran’s overall criminal history, evidence of rehabilitation, family and financial ties to the United States, employment history, health, and community service. The SAC and FOD must also consider factors related to the veteran’s military service, such as duty status (active or reserve), assignment to a war zone, number of years in service, and decorations awarded. To authorize issuance of the NTA, the SAC and FOD are to complete a memo to include in the veteran’s alien file and update ICE’s EARM database with a brief overview of the facts considered. Additionally, in November 2015, ICE’s Director issued a policy establishing ICE’s procedures for investigating the potential U.S. citizenship of individuals encountered by ICE. The policy states that prior military service is one of several indicators that an individual could be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, before issuing a NTA to a veteran or anyone with an indicator of potential U.S. citizenship, the ICE component that first encounters the individual (either HSI or ERO) is to conduct a factual examination, legal analysis, and a check of all available DHS systems, such as USCIS’s Person-Centric Query Service, to assess whether the individual is a U.S. citizen. ERO or HSI (whichever conducted the factual examination) and OPLA’s Office of Chief Counsel must jointly prepare a memorandum that assesses the individual’s citizenship status and recommends a course of action, then submit that memorandum for review and approval by ICE headquarters. The policy also requires that a copy of the memorandum be placed in the individual’s alien file. Our analysis of removed veterans’ alien files found that ICE does not consistently follow these policies. Specifically, ICE policies require agents and officers to document the decision to issue a NTA to a veteran, but do not require agents and officers to identify and document veteran status when interviewing potentially removable individuals. Our analysis found that ICE did not satisfy the 2004 requirement for FOD approval in 18 of 87 (21 percent) cases that OPLA’s check box indicated involved veterans who were placed into removal proceedings and ERO data indicated had been removed from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. Our analysis also found that ICE did not meet the requirements of the 2015 policy requiring elevation to headquarters in 26 of the 37 cases (70 percent) of the cases for which the policy applied. Further, in December 2018 HSI officials told us that HSI has not been adhering to either the 2004 or the 2015 policies because they were unaware of the policies prior to our review. HSI officials stated that they do not distinguish between veterans and nonveterans when conducting administrative or criminal investigations or when deciding whether to issue a NTA. ERO officials stated that the absence of documentation in the alien file does not necessarily indicate that officers did not adhere to the policies; however, as noted above, the policies specifically require ICE to add documentation to the alien file. Because ICE did not consistently follow these policies, some veterans who were removed may not have received the level of review and approval that ICE has determined is appropriate for cases involving veterans. Taking action to ensure consistent implementation of its policies for handling cases of potentially removable veterans, such as issuing guidance or providing training, would help ICE better ensure that potentially removable veterans receive appropriate levels of review and consideration prior to the initiation of removal proceedings. ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters. According to ERO officials, when ERO officers encounter an individual, they interview that individual and complete the Form I-213, “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien,” which documents information on, among other things, the individual’s country of citizenship and most recent employer. Officials stated that ERO officers would generally learn about the individual’s veteran status during that interview. However, ICE does not have a policy requiring agents and officers to specifically ask about and document veteran status. According to ERO officials, ERO does not need such a policy because ERO’s training for new officers, the Basic Immigration Enforcement Training Program, instructs officers to ask about veteran status when interviewing potentially removable aliens. The Basic Immigration Enforcement Training Program includes one lesson plan and one practice exercise stating that the I-213 “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien” should include information on military service, as applicable. The lesson plan also includes a list of mandatory questions that ERO officers must ask in every encounter with an alien; however, that list of mandatory questions does not include any questions about military service. Further, the I-213 “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien” does not have a specific field to indicate veteran status, and ERO’s cover sheet that supervisors use to review the legal sufficiency of NTAs does not contain information about veteran status. For cases processed by HSI, HSI officials stated that agents would generally learn about the individual’s veteran status through the initial interview or through background checks or other information obtained in the course of an HSI investigation. However, during the course of our review, HSI officials stated that there was no policy requiring agents to ask about or document veteran status because, as discussed above, HSI does not handle veterans’ cases differently from other cases. Without mechanisms in place to identify and document veterans, ICE is not positioned to determine whether or not individuals it encounters are potentially veterans and for which individuals the 2004 and 2015 policies discussed above for handling cases of potentially removable veterans should be applied. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should design control activities—that is, the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management’s directives to achieve the entity’s objectives. ICE officials told us that the 2004 and 2015 policies are intended to provide guidance and direction to ICE agents and officers for handling cases of potentially removable veterans. ICE officials believe that these policies could be updated with additional guidance to agents and officers to ask about and document veteran status during interviews of potentially removable individuals. Without developing and implementing a new policy or revising its 2004 and 2015 policies to require agents and officers to ask about and document veteran status, ICE has no way of knowing whether it has identified all of the veterans it has encountered and, therefore, does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies and procedures for handling veterans’ cases. Because ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data on veterans who have been placed in removal proceedings or removed. In the instances in which ICE agents and officers learn that they have encountered a veteran, none of the three ICE components who encounter veterans—ERO, OPLA, and HSI—maintain complete electronic data on the veterans they identify. ERO does not have a specific field for tracking veterans in its database, EARM. According to ERO officials, ERO officers can note veteran status on the Form I-213, “Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien,” but ERO does not have the ability to electronically search those notes to identify all of the veterans it has encountered. ERO officials stated that they do not maintain data on veteran status because they do not specifically target veterans for enforcement operations. OPLA has a check box tracking veteran status in its database, PLAnet, but the field is not mandatory. PLAnet also includes a case notes section, where an OPLA attorney may choose to document veteran status information. OPLA officials stated that the reliability of the veteran status box and case notes depends on the diligence of the attorney inputting the case information into PLAnet. HSI officials stated that they do not track veteran status at all because, as discussed above, veteran status does not affect their handling of cases. Our analysis of removed veterans’ alien files identified limitations with the only electronic data on veteran status ICE maintains—OPLA’s check box in the PLAnet database. Specifically, though OPLA’s check box indicated that all 87 of the aliens whose files we reviewed were veterans, we found that 8 of the 87 individuals (9 percent) did not serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, according to the information in their alien files. After reviewing these cases, OPLA officials stated that the individuals were incorrectly designated as veterans due to human error. OPLA officials stated that OPLA does not require attorneys to systematically track veteran status information in PLAnet because the database is not intended to be a data repository, but rather serves as a case management system for OPLA attorneys. OPLA officials stated that the official record of the alien’s case is the paper alien file. Because ICE does not maintain complete electronic data on potentially removable veterans it encounters, ICE does not know exactly how many veterans have been placed in removal proceedings or removed, or if their cases have been handled according to ICE’s policies. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management uses quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate the entity’s performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. Quality information is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely basis. While tracking veteran status in the paper alien file may allow ICE to review whether a specific individual is a veteran, it does not provide the type of complete and accessible electronic data that would allow the agency to systematically evaluate its performance in adhering to its policies. Maintaining complete electronic data on veterans it encounters would assist ICE in determining the extent to which the agency has adhered to its policies for handling cases involving potentially removable veterans. For example, ICE could obtain quality information through a mandatory field, such as a check box to track veteran status. Based on the limited information available in OPLA’s PLAnet database, approximately 250 veterans were placed in removal proceedings or removed from the United States from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. As noted above, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data on veterans it encounters. While OPLA’s PLAnet includes some data on veterans who have been placed in removal proceedings, because the entry of veteran status data in PLAnet is not mandatory, there could be additional veterans who were placed in removal proceedings or removed during the timeframe of our review who were not noted in PLAnet or included in our analysis, as discussed below. We reviewed the data that were included in PLAnet on veterans who were placed in removal proceedings from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 and identified approximately 250 military veterans. This includes those individuals for whom the check box indicating veteran status was checked in PLAnet but, as noted above, does not represent complete data on all possible veterans placed in removal proceedings during the time period we reviewed. Among the approximately 250 individuals who were noted in PLAnet as veterans in removal proceedings, the most common countries of nationality were Mexico (about 40), Jamaica (about 30), El Salvador (about 10), Trinidad and Tobago (about 10), Germany (about 10), and Guatemala (about 10). At the end of fiscal year 2018, about 115 had been ordered removed, about 25 had been granted relief or protection from removal by an immigration judge, and about 5 had their cases administratively closed. The remainder of the cases were still open as of November 2018. From fiscal year 2013 through 2018, ERO had removed 92 of the approximately 250 military veterans from the United States, of which 90 were foreign nationals with one or more criminal convictions, according to ERO data. Nine of the removed veterans had service-connected disabilities recognized by VA, including four removed veterans who had service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on our review of the alien files of 87 of the individuals that OPLA’s check box indicated were veterans and ERO indicated had been removed, we identified the following characteristics: 26 veterans (30 percent) received an honorable discharge; 26 (30 percent) received a general discharge under honorable conditions; 13 (15 percent) received an other than honorable discharge; 8 (9 percent) received an uncharacterized discharge; 3 (3 percent) received a bad conduct discharge; 2 (2 percent) received a dishonorable discharge; 8 (9 percent) had no evidence of military service in their alien file; and 1 (1 percent) did not have a discharge characterization listed in the alien file. 74 veterans (85 percent) were LPRs, 6 (7 percent) were citizens of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau who enlisted under the Compact of Free Association, 6 (7 percent) did not have evidence of lawful status, and 1 (1 percent) was a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. 26 veterans (30 percent) had previously applied for naturalization with USCIS; 3 of whom submitted multiple applications. Seventeen of those naturalization applications were denied by USCIS, 9 were administratively closed, and 2 were withdrawn. 68 veterans (78 percent) were ordered removed because of at least one aggravated felony conviction, while the remaining 19 (22 percent) were ordered removed for non-aggravated felony convictions. Of the convictions ICE cited on the 87 veterans’ NTAs: 32 veterans had drug-related convictions; 20 had convictions related to sexual abuse, of which 18 involved minors; 21 had convictions related to homicide, assault, or attempted homicides or assaults; 16 had theft-related convictions; and 9 had convictions related to firearms, explosives, or explosive material. USCIS and DOD have policies facilitating the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and both agencies provide informational resources to noncitizen service members seeking naturalization. USCIS facilitates the application and naturalization process for current and recently discharged members of the U.S. Armed Forces through a dedicated Military Naturalization Unit, which processes military naturalization applications and assists field officers with administrative naturalization tasks overseas, among other things. USCIS interviews and naturalizes active-duty service members abroad at certain U.S. embassies, consulates, and military installations. To provide information to noncitizen service members and veterans, USCIS maintains a toll-free “Military Help Line” and an e-mail box exclusively for members of the military and their families and publishes an “Immigration 101” presentation for relevant stakeholders, including DOD personnel on military bases. In addition, USCIS provides DOD with a checklist of required documents for military naturalization applications and communication guidelines for naturalization application inquiries, according to USCIS officials. DOD determines whether a service member meets the qualifying service requirement for naturalization by certifying whether the service member has served “honorably,” and if he or she has separated from service, whether their separation was under honorable conditions. Additionally, according to DOD officials, every military installation generally designates a naturalization advisor within its Legal Services Office. The advisor, among other things, assists service members with preparation of their naturalization application packets and serves as an intermediary with USCIS staff. For example, at many Army installations, the Army Community Services Office typically performs this function. Although USCIS approved military naturalization applications at a fairly consistent rate from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of applications received declined sharply from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, resulting in a decrease in the number of service members approved for naturalization in fiscal year 2018. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, USCIS received 54,617 military naturalization applications; USCIS approved 46,835 (86 percent) and denied 3,410 (6 percent). Applicants’ most common countries of nationality were the Philippines (6,267 or 11 percent), Mexico (5,760 or 11 percent), Jamaica (3,510 or 6 percent), China (3,213 or 6 percent), and the Republic of Korea (2,982 or 5 percent). While the number of military naturalization applications was relatively stable between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, applications declined by 72 percent from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018, from 11,812 in fiscal year 2017 to 3,291 in fiscal year 2018, as shown in figure 2. As a result of this decline in applications, the number of service members approved for naturalization also declined, from 7,303 in fiscal year 2017 to 4,309 in fiscal year 2018. USCIS and DOD officials attributed the decline in military naturalization applications to several DOD policy changes. First, DOD suspended the MAVNI program in September 2016, which reduced the number of noncitizens joining the military. According to DOD officials, due to counterintelligence concerns, DOD suspended the program at the end of fiscal year 2016 and decided not to renew the program in fiscal year 2017. Second, in October 2017, DOD issued policies expanding background check requirements for LPR and MAVNI recruits. The policies specify that LPRs must complete a background check and receive a favorable military service suitability determination prior to entering any component of the U.S. Armed Forces. According to DOD officials, due to backlogs in the background check process, these new recruits were delayed in beginning their service, and officials stated that it may take DOD up to a year to complete enhanced requirements for certain recruits. DOD officials stated that they believe background check backlogs will decrease by the end of fiscal year 2019 and, as a result, the number of noncitizen service members eligible to apply for naturalization will increase. Third, in October 2017, DOD increased the amount of time noncitizens must serve before DOD will certify their honorable service for naturalization purposes. Under the new policy, noncitizens must complete security screening, basic military training, and serve 180 days for a characterization of service determination. Previously, DOD granted that determination in as little as a few days of service. USCIS made several changes to its military naturalization processes in response to or in tandem with DOD’s policy changes. First, in July 2017, USCIS determined that the completion of DOD background checks was relevant to MAVNI recruits’ eligibility for naturalization. USCIS thus began requiring currently-serving MAVNI recruits seeking military naturalization to complete all required DOD background checks before USCIS interviewed them, approved their applications, or administered the Oath of Allegiance to naturalize them. Second, in January 2018, USCIS ended its initiative to naturalize new enlistees at basic training sites. This initiative, known as the “Naturalization at Basic Training Initiative”, began in August 2009 as an effort to conduct outreach to new enlistees at the Army’s five basic training sites and provide noncitizen enlistees an opportunity to naturalize prior to completion of basic training. Because of DOD’s October 2017 policy change increasing the amount of time noncitizens must serve before they are eligible for a characterization of service determination, noncitizen service members no longer meet the requirements for naturalization while they are completing basic training. As a result, USCIS closed naturalization offices in Fort Sill, Fort Benning, and Fort Jackson. USCIS’s processing time for military naturalizations also increased, from an average of 5.4 months in fiscal year 2017 to 12.5 months in fiscal year 2018, according to USCIS data. USCIS officials attributed this increase to the backlog in DOD background checks for MAVNI recruits, as well as an increased volume of naturalization applications from non-military applicants. Citizenship status, including immigration enforcement or removal history, does not affect a veteran’s eligibility for VA benefits and services, according to VA officials. As a result, veterans who have been removed by ICE are entitled to the same VA benefits and services as any other veteran living abroad. Although being removed for violation of immigration law does not in and of itself affect eligibility for VA benefits and services, living abroad affects eligibility for certain benefits and services, as shown in table 1. These differences pertain to all veterans living abroad, including both veterans who have been removed by ICE and veterans who choose to reside abroad. Removed veterans may face additional obstacles in receiving certain benefits for which they are otherwise eligible because they may be barred from traveling to the United States. For example, a removed veteran may not be able to attend a hearing to appeal a VA disability rating decision because VA conducts those hearings exclusively in the United States. Additionally, a removed veteran may not be able to obtain certain Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services if the veteran is unable to travel to the United States for medical referrals and case management. Veterans living abroad, including removed veterans, may experience challenges accessing certain benefits and services, including slower disability claim processing and Foreign Medical Program (FMP) claim reimbursement, difficulties related to the scheduling and quality of C&P exams, and difficulties communicating with VA. According to VA officials, VA’s processing time for disability compensation claims for veterans living abroad (foreign claims) has improved since fiscal year 2013. For example, in fiscal year 2013, VA processed foreign claims in an average of 521 days and in fiscal year 2018, VA’s processing time for foreign claims decreased to an average of 131 days. However, as of September 2018, VA was not meeting its timeliness goal of 125 days for processing foreign claims and VA took an average of 29 days longer to process foreign claims than domestic claims. VA officials attributed the longer processing times for foreign claims to unreliable foreign mail systems and issues with retrieving and translating foreign records, among other things. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, VA received disability compensation claims from 26,858 veterans living abroad and awarded over $85 million in benefits, according to VA data. According to VA officials, VA’s processing time for health care claims reimbursements to veterans or their medical providers for treatment of service-connected conditions through FMP has also improved. For example, in October 2018, FMP was processing 53.8 percent of claims in 40 days compared to 70 percent of claims in 40 days in March 2019. However, as of March 2019, VA was not meeting its timeliness goal to process 90 percent of claims reimbursements through FMP in 40 days. FMP officials attributed these delays to the loss of four staff positions in April 2017, as well as FMP assuming responsibility for claims from the Philippines in October 2017. To improve FMP’s processing timeliness, FMP officials stated that VA funded three new full-time equivalent positions for fiscal year 2019. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, VA reported receiving 373,916 claims reimbursements from veterans and providers living abroad and awarding over $169 million in claims reimbursements. According to both VA and VSO officials, veterans living abroad, including removed veterans, face challenges related to the scheduling and quality of C&P exams. As previously noted, veterans living abroad do not receive C&P exams from VA medical providers, but may receive exams from either a VA contractor or, in countries where VA does not have contractors, from a private provider scheduled by the U.S. embassy or consulate. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, VA completed over 27,000 exams abroad through contractors and 6,800 exams through U.S. embassies and consulates, according to VA data. For contract exams, as of March 2019, VA had contractors in 33 countries and U.S. territories. This included Mexico, Germany, Belize, Canada, the Dominican Republic, the Federated States of Micronesia, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand, Costa Rica, Korea, and Poland, which were among the most common countries of nationality for removed veterans in our analysis. VA officials stated that contract C&P exam locations are determined by historical and pending claims data. Moreover, VA contractors abroad are generally located near military installations or areas in which VA determined there is a large veteran population. For embassy-scheduled exams, both VA and VSO officials told us that the effectiveness of coordination between VA and the embassies varies by country. For example, VA staff told us that they have been unable to schedule exams through embassies in Iraq or Afghanistan. State officials told us that processes for scheduling C&P exams and communicating with VA vary depending on the location, activity, and size of the embassy or consulate. State officials also told us that access to specialized providers to conduct exams, including mental health or audio exams, depends on the location of the embassy or consulate. In addition, both VA and VSO officials told us that veterans who receive embassy-scheduled exams from private providers abroad may receive lower-quality exams than veterans who live in the United States. For example, providers abroad may misinterpret VA exam requirements due to language barriers or unfamiliarity with U.S. medical terminology. These providers also do not have access to veterans’ service records, and therefore cannot assess whether a particular condition is service- connected. For these reasons, VA officials told us that VA staff submit C&P exams completed by private providers abroad to the VA Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for an additional medical opinion. According to VA officials, VA is improving the scheduling and quality of C&P exams by expanding the number of countries where veterans may receive exams from VA contractors. According to VA and VSO officials, veterans living abroad experience challenges communicating with the VA. For example, staff from all four VSOs we interviewed stated that unreliable foreign mail systems and differences in time zones make it challenging for veterans to communicate with the VA, particularly because VA uses paper mail to communicate with veterans living abroad. In addition, VA and VSO officials also told us that veterans living abroad may face challenges applying for and managing their benefits through an online portal maintained by VA and DOD, eBenefits. VA requires veterans to register for a “premium account” in order to access all of the functions of eBenefits, such as applying for benefits online and checking the status of a claim, among other things. To be eligible for a “premium account,” veterans must first verify their identity with DOD. If the veteran provides valid government identification (e.g. driver’s license) and documentation of a financial account (e.g. checking account), DOD may be able to verify the veteran’s identity through an online registration process and VA may be able to verify the veteran’s identity by telephone. If a veteran is unable to verify their identity in this manner, the veteran must verify their identity in-person at a VA regional office in the United States. Therefore, removed veterans who cannot travel to the United States would not be able to obtain a “premium account” if they had not previously registered prior to their removal. VA officials stated that these processes are intended to ensure compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology guidance for online credentialing. Throughout U.S. history, noncitizens have contributed to the United States through service in the Armed Forces. Through its policies, ICE has established that these noncitizen veterans warrant special consideration in the event that they become subject to immigration enforcement and removal from the United States. However, because ICE did not consistently adhere to these policies, some veterans who were removed may not have received the level of review and approval that ICE has determined is appropriate for cases involving veterans. Moreover, without developing and implementing a new policy or revising its 2004 and 2015 policies to require ICE agents and officers to ask about and document veteran status while interviewing potentially removable individuals, ICE has no way of knowing whether it has identified all of the veterans it has encountered and, therefore, does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies and procedures for handling veterans’ cases. Further, maintaining complete electronic data on veterans it encounters would also allow ICE to better assess whether ICE has adhered to its policies for handling cases involving potentially removable veterans. We are making the following three recommendations to ICE: The Director of ICE should take action to ensure consistent implementation of ICE’s policies for handling cases of potentially removable veterans. (Recommendation 1) The Director of ICE should develop and implement a policy or revise its current polices to ensure that ICE agents and officers identify and document veteran status when interviewing potentially removable individuals. (Recommendation 2) The Director of ICE should collect and maintain complete and electronic data on veterans in removal proceedings or who have been removed. (Recommendation 3) We provided a copy of this report to DHS, VA, DOD, and State for review and comment. DHS provided written comments, which are reproduced in full in appendix I and discussed below. DHS, VA, and DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. State indicated that it did not have any comments on the draft report. In its comments, DHS concurred with our three recommendations and described actions planned to address them. With respect to our first recommendation that ICE should ensure consistent implementation of its policies for handling potentially removable veterans, DHS concurred stating that ICE plans, among other things, to update its guidance and training materials to include information about military service. With respect to our second recommendation that ICE should develop and implement a policy or revise its current policies to ensure agents and officers identify and document veteran status when interviewing potentially removable individuals, DHS concurred, stating that ICE plans to review and clarify existing guidance on the issuance of NTAs to veterans. DHS also concurred with our third recommendation that ICE collect and maintain complete and electronic data on veterans in removal proceedings or who have been removed. Specifically, DHS stated that ICE plans to add data elements for veteran status to its existing systems. The actions described above, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of our recommendations. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Acting Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and other interested parties.

Although the Immigration and Nationality Act allows noncitizen service members to acquire citizenship, some veterans may not apply or may not satisfy all eligibility criteria. If the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that a noncitizen veteran is potentially removable, the veteran may be subject to administrative immigration enforcement and removal. ICE, among other things, is responsible for identifying and removing aliens who violate U.S. immigration law. GAO was asked to review issues related to the removal of noncitizen veterans. This report examines (1) the extent to which ICE has developed and implemented policies for handling and tracking cases of potentially removable veterans; (2) how federal agencies facilitate the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and what is known about the number who have applied for naturalization; and (3) how removal affects veterans' eligibility for and access to VA benefits and services. GAO reviewed documentation, met with agency officials, analyzed available data on veterans placed in removal proceedings, and conducted a review of removed veterans' alien files. GAO also analyzed data on military naturalization applications. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has developed policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans who may be subject to removal from the United States, but does not consistently adhere to those policies, and does not consistently identify and track such veterans. When ICE agents and officers learn they have encountered a potentially removable veteran, ICE policies require them to take additional steps to proceed with the case. GAO found that ICE did not consistently follow its policies involving veterans who were placed in removal proceedings from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. Consistent implementation of its policies would help ICE better ensure that veterans receive appropriate levels of review before they are placed in removal proceedings. Additionally, ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters during interviews, and in cases when agents and officers do learn they have encountered a veteran, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data. Therefore, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies for handling veterans' cases. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have policies facilitating the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and provide informational resources to noncitizen service members seeking naturalization. The number of military naturalization applications received by USCIS declined sharply from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, resulting in a decreased number of applications approved in fiscal year 2018. USCIS and DOD officials attributed this decline to several DOD policy changes that reduced the number of noncitizens joining the military . Citizenship status, including removal history, does not affect a veteran's eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and services. However, living abroad affects eligibility for certain VA benefits and services. Veterans living abroad may also experience challenges accessing certain benefits and services, such as slower disability claim processing. GAO recommends that ICE (1) ensure consistent implementation of its existing policies for handling veterans' cases; (2) develop a policy or revise its current policies to identify and document veterans; and (3) collect and maintain complete data on veterans in removal proceedings or who have been removed. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.", "summary": "The text discusses the naturalization process for noncitizen service members in the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies for handling cases involving potentially removable veterans.

Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period for each component agency. Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period, while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92 days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time, notifications occurred on average about 1 ½ months later. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees that they notified within the required time period, while other component agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees. For example, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period, substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table 3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors. Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process. These reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review, conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible. Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it received. Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time needed. For example: Two component agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—notified none of their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through 2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees, these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business awardees. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process, and an internal review by the SBIR program office. Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards later in the fiscal year. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment. The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards. In this report, we took steps to eliminate these outliers from the data. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Administrator of the SBA, and other interested parties.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix describes the awards made by agencies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, based on the data provided to GAO for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. These data include figures showing the (1) proposal review and notification time, (2) award issuance time, and (3) distribution of awards by fiscal year and phase. The fiscal year and phase figure describes the number of phase I and phase II awards issued in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and is based on the first year of the award activities. For example, if an agency obligated funding to a phase II award in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the award is counted among the fiscal year 2017 phase II awards. NIST participated in SBIR only.

Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed the timeliness of proposal notifications and award issuances for SBIR and STTR programs from fiscal years 2016 to 2018. Out of 15,453 awards, 84% were notified within the required time frame, while 16% were delayed. Factors affecting notification times included reviewer availability, the number of proposals, and agency-specific processes. For award issuance, 76% of awards were issued within the recommended time, with 24% delayed. Delays were often due to complex contract types, staffing issues, coordination challenges, awardee responsiveness, and funding availability. Some agencies, like the Air Force, implemented changes to improve timeliness.

Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards. In this report, we took steps to eliminate these outliers from the data. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Administrator of the SBA, and other interested parties.

Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "The text discusses an analysis of SBIR and STTR award notification and issuance timeliness across various federal agencies from 2016-2018. Key findings include: 84% of awards (12,890 of 15,453) were notified within required timeframes (90 days for most agencies, 1 year for NIH and NSF). For award issuance, 76% of awards were issued within recommended timeframes (180 days for most agencies, 15 months for NIH and NSF). Several factors affected timeliness, including reviewer availability, proposal volume, contract types (cost reimbursement contracts taking longer than fixed-price), availability of contracting officers, coordination challenges among agency officials, awardee responsiveness, and funding availability. Some agencies showed significant year-to-year variation in timeliness, while others remained consistent. The report notes that some agencies, like the Air Force, implemented process improvements to reduce delays.

{"uid": "MSumBench_0426", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_147", "summary_model": "csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum", "input_text": "Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees within the required time for 12,890 of the 15,453 SBIR and STTR awards that we reviewed (84 percent), for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most agencies notify applicants of the agency’s decision within 90 calendar days and require NIH and NSF do so in 1 year. Agencies notified awardees after the required time period for 2,533 of 15,453 awards (16 percent). Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period for each component agency. Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period, while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92 days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time, notifications occurred on average about 1 ½ months later. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees that they notified within the required time period, while other component agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees. For example, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period, substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table 3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors. Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process. These reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review, conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible. Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it received. Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time needed. For example: Two component agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—notified none of their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through 2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees, these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business awardees. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process, and an internal review by the SBIR program office. Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards later in the fiscal year. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment. The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards.

The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV.

{"uid": "MSumBench_0427", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_147", "summary_model": "facebook/bart-large-cnn", "input_text": "Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees within the required time for 12,890 of the 15,453 SBIR and STTR awards that we reviewed (84 percent), for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most agencies notify applicants of the agency’s decision within 90 calendar days and require NIH and NSF do so in 1 year. Agencies notified awardees after the required time period for 2,533 of 15,453 awards (16 percent). Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period for each component agency. Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period, while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92 days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time, notifications occurred on average about 1 ½ months later. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees that they notified within the required time period, while other component agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees. For example, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period, substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table 3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors. Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process. These reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review, conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible. Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it received. Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time needed. For example: Two component agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—notified none of their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through 2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees, these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business awardees. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process, and an internal review by the SBIR program office. Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards later in the fiscal year. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment. The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards. In this report, we took steps to eliminate these outliers from the data. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Administrator of the SBA, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix describes the awards made by agencies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, based on the data provided to GAO for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. These data include figures showing the (1) proposal review and notification time, (2) award issuance time, and (3) distribution of awards by fiscal year and phase. The fiscal year and phase figure describes the number of phase I and phase II awards issued in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and is based on the first year of the award activities. For example, if an agency obligated funding to a phase II award in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the award is counted among the fiscal year 2017 phase II awards. NIST participated in SBIR only.

Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period.

The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards. In this report, we took steps to eliminate these outliers from the data. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Administrator of the SBA, and other interested parties.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix describes the awards made by agencies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, based on the data provided to GAO for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. These data include figures showing the (1) proposal review and notification time, (2) award issuance time, and (3) distribution of awards by fiscal year and phase. The fiscal year and phase figure describes the number of phase I and phase II awards issued in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and is based on the first year of the award activities. For example, if an agency obligated funding to a phase II award in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the award is counted among the fiscal year 2017 phase II awards. NIST participated in SBIR only. NOAA participated in SBIR only. Air Force participated in SBIR and STTR.

Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "This report examines the timeliness of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which provide funding to small businesses for research and development. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed data from 28 federal agencies for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and found that while most agencies met the required timeframes for notifying awardees and issuing awards, some agencies consistently experienced delays. The report identifies several factors contributing to these delays, including the availability of reviewers, the number of proposals received, and agency-specific processes. The GAO recommends that agencies take steps to improve the timeliness of their SBIR and STTR programs, such as streamlining review processes and providing additional training to staff involved in the award process.", "keyfacts": ["Component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees within the required time for 84 percent of SBIR and STTR awards from fiscal years 2016 through 2018.", "Agencies notified awardees after the required time period for 16 percent of awards.", "Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award.", "Nine additional component agencies met the notification requirement for at least 90 percent of their awards.", "The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards.", "The Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most agencies to notify applicants within 90 calendar days.", "NIH and NSF are required to notify applicants within 1 year.", "Some component agencies had substantial changes in the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period from year to year.", "Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a fiscal year with less than 50 percent of awardees notified within the required time.", "Agency officials described factors affecting review and notification time, including reviewer availability and number of proposals.", "USDA officials said they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for external peer review.", "Navy officials said reviewer availability was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process.", "Department of Education identifies and trains reviewers before receiving proposals.", "The number of proposals affects the time spent reviewing and notifying awardees.", "EPA's review process includes three consecutive reviews, leading to regular requests for waivers to exceed the 90-day requirement.", "Continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns can slow proposal review.", "Defense Microelectronics Activity completes proposal review within 90 days but delays notification until funding availability is determined.", "Component agencies issued 76 percent of awards within the recommended time period for fiscal years 2016 through 2018.", "SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends most agencies issue an award within 180 days.", "NIH and NSF are recommended to issue awards within 15 months.", "Three of 28 component agencies issued every award within the recommended time.", "Five additional component agencies issued at least 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time.", "The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period.", "Cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue than fixed-price contracts.", "DARPA officials said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award.", "Availability of grants or contracting officers affects the time to issue awards.", "Coordination among agency officials can create delays in the award process.", "Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process to reduce coordination delays.", "Responsiveness of small businesses can delay award issuance.", "Delays in determining funding availability can delay award issuance.", "SBA and Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports.", "SBA described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards.", "Department of Defense stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its timeliness requirements."], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [0, 0, 1, 0], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.25, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.12121212121212122, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 0, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.5}
{"uid": "MSumBench_0429", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_147", "summary_model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "input_text": "Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees within the required time for 12,890 of the 15,453 SBIR and STTR awards that we reviewed (84 percent), for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most agencies notify applicants of the agency’s decision within 90 calendar days and require NIH and NSF do so in 1 year. Agencies notified awardees after the required time period for 2,533 of 15,453 awards (16 percent). Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period for each component agency. Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period, while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92 days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time, notifications occurred on average about 1 ½ months later. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees that they notified within the required time period, while other component agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees. For example, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period, substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table 3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors. Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process. These reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review, conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible. Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it received. Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time needed. For example: Two component agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—notified none of their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through 2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees, these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business awardees. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process, and an internal review by the SBIR program office. Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards later in the fiscal year. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment. The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements.

Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards.

{"uid": "MSumBench_0430", "dataset": "govreport", "domain": "report", "doc_id": "GOVREPORT_147", "summary_model": "models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest", "input_text": "Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees within the required time for 12,890 of the 15,453 SBIR and STTR awards that we reviewed (84 percent), for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most agencies notify applicants of the agency’s decision within 90 calendar days and require NIH and NSF do so in 1 year. Agencies notified awardees after the required time period for 2,533 of 15,453 awards (16 percent). Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the required time period for each component agency. Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period, while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92 days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time, notifications occurred on average about 1 ½ months later. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees that they notified within the required time period, while other component agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees. For example, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the Army SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period, substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table 3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors. Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in completing their proposal review and notification process. These reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review, conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible. Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it received. Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases the workload of proposal reviewers. Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time needed. For example: Two component agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—notified none of their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through 2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees, these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business awardees. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process, and an internal review by the SBIR program office. Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions, sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards later in the fiscal year. National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment. The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the 90-day requirement. Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453 awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28 component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the recommended time period. For the 3,743 awards that agencies issued after the recommended time period, the average award was issued about two and a half months after the recommended time. Table 4 lists the mean and median award issuance times and the percent of awards issued within the recommended time for each component agency. During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awards they issued within the recommended time period, while other component agencies consistently issued about the same percentage of awards within the recommended time period. For example, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5 describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined. Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3) delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards. Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically, officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because of the need to review the awardee’s accounting system in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism. Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231 days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or cost reimbursement. Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second, officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer’s level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because the proposal review and award process can require coordination among multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year 2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited process. Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must, among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership, and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD’s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests for additional information could help reduce the time between when a solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded. Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials said that they estimate the agency’s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards. According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer issuance times for some awards. We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 for their review and comment. The SBA, Department of Defense, and Department of Education provided written comments that are reproduced in Appendix II, III, and IV. In addition, the Department of Energy, the NIH within the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The remaining agencies told us they had no comment. In its formal comments, the Department of Education stated that it has taken steps to ensure that future awardees will be notified within the required period. In their comments, SBA and the Department of Defense suggested phase I and II awards should be evaluated separately in future reports. In this report, we combined phase I and II awards because we did not find a statistically significant difference in notification time between phase I and II awards in the fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data that we examined. However, some analyses showed that phase II awards took longer to issue. We may further examine differences between phase I and phase II awards in subsequent reports. SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to retain key personnel. SBA also sought explanations for various dates and figures used in our analysis and we updated the report to include the definitions used when collecting award data and to describe our figures in more detail. The Department of Defense also stated that the SBIR and STTR policy directive does not explicitly include phase II awards in its 90 and 180-day timeliness requirements. However, we confirmed with SBA—the agency that issues the directive—that the 90-day requirement for notification of selection and the 180-day recommendation for award issuance apply to both phase I and phase II awards. The Department of Defense further stated that subsequent phase II awards could occur several years after the end of the initial phase II award and should not be included in the analysis of phase II awards. In this report, we took steps to eliminate these outliers from the data. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Administrator of the SBA, and other interested parties.

SHELLEY WALCOTT, CO-HOST: Happy Monday and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Shelley Walcott. A lot ahead today. Here's what's coming up. President Bush hits the ground running his first week in office. We'll take a look at what he's got planned. Then, in \"Environment Desk,\" new homes near Atlanta that could save owners a lot of money. From the suburbs of the U.S. to the wilds of Russia, \"Worldview\" zeros in on the wolf. And in \"Chronicle,\" a high school band in a high-profile performance. The United States presidency changes hands, creating a weekend of beginnings and endings, parties and protests. President George W. Bush was sworn in Saturday as the nation's 43rd president. A controversial yet smooth shift in power this weekend. Former President Clinton bid farewell to a position he's held for eight years, placing his executive responsibilities in the hands of his replacement, President George W. Bush. In his 14-minute inaugural address, President Bush promised to unite America and lead with civility and compassion.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.</s>WALCOTT: A three-hour parade followed the inauguration ceremony and a series of inaugural balls followed that. And while thousands of Americans cheered Mr. Bush on his big day, thousands more protested vigorously, creating what one presidential historian called the largest inaugural protest since Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The upcoming week will be busy for Mr. Bush as he gets down to business on education, the economy and tax cuts. During his first full day in office, President George W. Bush picked up more support for his huge tax cut plan. Mr. Bush is proposing a 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut. Patty Davis has more now on the tax plan and the Democratic senator who's agreed to support it.</s>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his first full day in office, a big boost for President George W. Bush and his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell Miller plans to co-sponsor Bush's tax cut with Republican Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm.</s>ANDREW CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm thrilled if Sen. Gramm has found a Democratic co-sponsor. We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal. Patty Davis, CNN, Capitol Hill.</s>WALCOTT: Cold weather and soaring energy costs. For many Americans this winter, its an expensive combination. Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on. The numbers are huge, 700 Earthcraft homes being built in Atlanta, thousands more similarly green being constructed across the nation. Brian Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.</s>WALCOTT: In \"Worldview\" today, we check out the environment, business and politics. Are world tour takes us to Russia to spotlight religion and a Jewish revival. More from the region as we focus on the call of the wild and wolves. We also journey to Jamaica for a bit of history and culture. But first we focus on Iraq and Kuwait. It was 10 years ago that U.S. President George Bush led an allied attack to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. Now as the son of the former U.S. president becomes commander-in-chief, our Jane Arraf looks at the view from an old adversary.</s>JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a region that understands dynasties, George W. Bush following in his father's footsteps to the White House is no surprise. But in Iraq, the name Bush is synonymous with war. This woman struggles to remember what she was doing in 1991 until a neighbor prompts her: \"the Bush War.\" In the Gulf states, which went to war to free Kuwait, then- President George Bush was a hero. In Iraq, he was a villain, a legacy literally set in stone at Baghdad's government owned Rashid Hotel. The hotel was hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1993 after an alleged Iraqi plot to kill the former U.S. president. (on camera): Iraq denies the plot, but says the United States has been trying to get rid of President Saddam Hussein for years. (voice-over): One familiar face in the new U.S. Cabinet, Gulf War Gen. Colin Powell, is again talking about unfinished business with Iraq.</s>TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: What business does he have with Iraq, you see? If he wants to continue the aggressive policy which the previous administration, in which he was the chief of staff, took against Iraq, it's up to him.</s>ARRAF: Officials are ridiculing plans for increased U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition.</s>AZIZ: Let them spend more money on those crooks. If they have a surplus in the American budget to spend on those people rather than spending it on health care or education in the United States, let them spend that money.</s>ARRAF: Iraq says it doesn't matter to the government here who's in the White House, but the issue is so sensitive it won't let journalists ask Iraqis what they think of the new U.S. president. Iraq, though, will be keeping as much of an eye on the new U.S. administration as the administration is on Iraq. Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green. When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be my queen.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: In the evening, over on the West Coast in Negril, watching the sunset at Rick's cafe is a long-standing tradition.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will drive as far as from Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, which is sometimes three and four hours, to come and see us. We are packed all the time.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: While guests wait for the sun to set, they enjoy some of Rick's Jamaican cuisine and rock to the rhythms of Reggae music. The more daring visitors can dive from cliffs 50-feet high. But the locals outdo them all by climbing even higher and jumping from the trees.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard so much about it. It's everything they say.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: And it Jamaica, the fun doesn't depend on the weather.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen 250 people toast a cloudy, rainy sky at the very moment that the sun should be hitting the horizon. Doesn't matter, man. In Jamaica, everything cool, man.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Negril, Jamaica.</s>TOM HAYNES, CO-HOST: The Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. What remained was Greater Russia and 10 former Soviet republics. After the breakup, Russia claimed those republics to be part of the new commonwealth of independent states. But ethnic disputes soon emerged among those who didn't want to be part of the new Russian federation and tensions ensued. To lend moral guidance, the Russian Orthodox Church reestablished itself after years of communist repression. Since then, other religions have also reemerged. Steve Harrigan reports on a religious homecoming of sorts.</s>STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As newborn baby Mark Segal (ph) and his family left Russia for the United States, Jews in search of religious freedom. Now they've come back to Moscow to celebrate Mark's bar mitzvah.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel it's really like my home.</s>HARRIGAN: A community whose members often tried to hide their identity in the old Soviet Union or emigrate to the West is taking on a new, much more public role at home.</s>BERL LAZAR, CHIEF RABBI OF RUSSIA: The numbers are incredible. Today we believe that we are in touch with over a million Jews.</s>HARRIGAN: Russian President Vladimir Putin helped unveil a $12 million Jewish community center on the same site where a synagogue was bombed twice and burned once in the last 10 years. the ex-KGB colonel called decades of state persecution absurd.</s>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): People were forced to study their own language underground in secret. Who will live in such a country?</s>HARRIGAN: Hebrew lessons are out in the open today, but not all Jews welcome the government's embrace. Rival factions say Russia's new chief rabbi was hand-picked by the Kremlin.</s>PINCHAS GOLDSCHMIDT, CHIEF RABBI OF MOSCOW: We see a very long tradition -- Russian tradition -- not only communist, a very long Russian tradition of trying to control and influence religious groups.</s>HARRIGAN: If that tradition still exists, the methods have certainly changed, from open violence just a few years ago to smiles and handshakes today. Steve Harrigan, CNN, Moscow.</s>RUDI BAKHTIAR, CO-HOST: More from Russia as we turn to the wild kingdom. We look at one of the largest members of the dog family, the wolf. Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others. Gary Strieker, CNN, Bordanesz (ph), Russia.</s>WALCOTT: Well, it was a big weekend for the new U.S. president. The inauguration didn't stop at President Bush's swearing-in. The rest of the day included a parade, a church service, and parties, parties, parties. We sent our Washington NEWSROOM correspondent Mike McManus to the inaugural balls to find out what the young people hope can be accomplished in this new administration.</s>MIKE MCMANUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Bush's inauguration speech centered on an issue familiar with his campaign.</s>BUSH: Our unity, our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.</s>MCMANUS: Fritz Brogan is a 16-year-old very familiar with the issue.</s>FRITZ BROGAN, AGE 16: It's time to celebrate. It's been a long and arduous race, but it's over.</s>MCMANUS: He's from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ground zero in the election recount. Brogan celebrated inauguration night in the nation's capital at the Florida inaugural ball.</s>BROGAN: A lot of people's toes were stepped over during the election. Many people thought that their right to vote was sacrificed. But I think, together, George W. Bush can do a great job of bringing America back together.</s>MCMANUS: Brogan is a Bush supporter and was active in his campaign for president. The high school sophomore even started his own Web site specifically for teenagers interested in the Bush-Cheney ticket.</s>BROGAN: The Internet's the one thing that unites youth. Pretty much everyone out there has a computer and e-mail address, so I was able to contact kids from across the country, even across the world.</s>MCMANUS (on camera): Bringing two deeply divided political parties together may be top on the president's list. But as with any leader, success will not be measured by promises. Young voters are looking for results. Are you going to hold him to those promises?</s>BROGAN: I will hold him to his promises, yes.</s>MCMANUS (voice-over): Other young partygoers were more interested in the new president's campaign promise of reforming the U.S. education system.</s>BUSH: Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.</s>KATELIN SULLIVAN, AGE 18: Every student should have the opportunity to attend whatever school is the best for them, fits them the best, their style of learning.</s>JAMIE BLOSSER, AGE 16: I like his point about not leaving anyone behind. Every child should get an education no matter, you know, if they're rich or poor and where they live. I think that's so important.</s>MCMANUS: Another point of interest was President Bush's thoughts on the slowing economy.</s>BUSH: We will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.</s>CHRIS ROOD, AGE 21: It's important to me because I -- so I have a job when I'm older, you know, keep a job and have a family.</s>MCMANUS: These young people assembled for the inauguration said they were excited about ideas the new administration bring to Washington, but also know there are challenges ahead for Both 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill.

But what if you're in the high school band and the Presidential Inaugural Committee asks you to perform for the new president? Our Jason Bellini reports the words \"excitement\" and, yes, \"nervousness\" take on a whole new meaning.</s>JASON BELLINI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the bands marching in the inaugural parade, the day started early in a parking lot at the Pentagon. Thirty high school and college bands were chosen by the Inaugural Committee for the honor of performing for the new president. I followed through the day a band from Papillion-LaVista High School in Omaha, Nebraska. If you're a band that made it all the way to here, you know that you're among the best of the best. So as bands were warming up, they checked out one another.

That is the cutest thing.</s>BELLINI: Around 11:50 a.m., the inaugural ceremony began. The bus driver turned the radio to it. From the bus to a holding tent next for hot chocolate and more time to mingle with the other bands.

From the suburbs of the U.S. to the wilds of Russia, \"Worldview\" zeros in on the wolf. And in \"Chronicle,\" a high school band in a high-profile performance. The United States presidency changes hands, creating a weekend of beginnings and endings, parties and protests. President George W. Bush was sworn in Saturday as the nation's 43rd president. A controversial yet smooth shift in power this weekend. Former President Clinton bid farewell to a position he's held for eight years, placing his executive responsibilities in the hands of his replacement, President George W. Bush. In his 14-minute inaugural address, President Bush promised to unite America and lead with civility and compassion.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.</s>WALCOTT: A three-hour parade followed the inauguration ceremony and a series of inaugural balls followed that. And while thousands of Americans cheered Mr. Bush on his big day, thousands more protested vigorously, creating what one presidential historian called the largest inaugural protest since Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The upcoming week will be busy for Mr. Bush as he gets down to business on education, the economy and tax cuts. During his first full day in office, President George W. Bush picked up more support for his huge tax cut plan. Mr. Bush is proposing a 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut. Patty Davis has more now on the tax plan and the Democratic senator who's agreed to support it.</s>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his first full day in office, a big boost for President George W. Bush and his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell Miller plans to co-sponsor Bush's tax cut with Republican Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm.</s>ANDREW CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm thrilled if Sen. Gramm has found a Democratic co-sponsor. We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal.

Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on. The numbers are huge, 700 Earthcraft homes being built in Atlanta, thousands more similarly green being constructed across the nation.

Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others.

The high school sophomore even started his own Web site specifically for teenagers interested in the Bush-Cheney ticket.</s>BROGAN: The Internet's the one thing that unites youth. Pretty much everyone out there has a computer and e-mail address, so I was able to contact kids from across the country, even across the world.</s>MCMANUS (on camera): Bringing two deeply divided political parties together may be top on the president's list.

Thirty high school and college bands were chosen by the Inaugural Committee for the honor of performing for the new president. I followed through the day a band from Papillion-LaVista High School in Omaha, Nebraska. If you're a band that made it all the way to here, you know that you're among the best of the best. So as bands were warming up, they checked out one another.

SHELLEY WALCOTT, CO-HOST: Happy Monday and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Shelley Walcott. A lot ahead today. Here's what's coming up. President Bush hits the ground running his first week in office. We'll take a look at what he's got planned. Then, in \"Environment Desk,\" new homes near Atlanta that could save owners a lot of money. From the suburbs of the U.S. to the wilds of Russia, \"Worldview\" zeros in on the wolf. And in \"Chronicle,\" a high school band in a high-profile performance. The United States presidency changes hands, creating a weekend of beginnings and endings, parties and protests. President George W. Bush was sworn in Saturday as the nation's 43rd president. A controversial yet smooth shift in power this weekend. Former President Clinton bid farewell to a position he's held for eight years, placing his executive responsibilities in the hands of his replacement, President George W. Bush. In his 14-minute inaugural address, President Bush promised to unite America and lead with civility and compassion.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.</s>WALCOTT: A three-hour parade followed the inauguration ceremony and a series of inaugural balls followed that. And while thousands of Americans cheered Mr. Bush on his big day, thousands more protested vigorously, creating what one presidential historian called the largest inaugural protest since Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The upcoming week will be busy for Mr. Bush as he gets down to business on education, the economy and tax cuts. During his first full day in office, President George W. Bush picked up more support for his huge tax cut plan. Mr. Bush is proposing a 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut. Patty Davis has more now on the tax plan and the Democratic senator who's agreed to support it.</s>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his first full day in office, a big boost for President George W. Bush and his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell Miller plans to co-sponsor Bush's tax cut with Republican Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm.</s>ANDREW CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm thrilled if Sen. Gramm has found a Democratic co-sponsor. We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal. Patty Davis, CNN, Capitol Hill.</s>WALCOTT: Cold weather and soaring energy costs. For many Americans this winter, its an expensive combination. Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on. The numbers are huge, 700 Earthcraft homes being built in Atlanta, thousands more similarly green being constructed across the nation. Brian Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.</s>WALCOTT: In \"Worldview\" today, we check out the environment, business and politics. Are world tour takes us to Russia to spotlight religion and a Jewish revival. More from the region as we focus on the call of the wild and wolves. We also journey to Jamaica for a bit of history and culture. But first we focus on Iraq and Kuwait. It was 10 years ago that U.S. President George Bush led an allied attack to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. Now as the son of the former U.S. president becomes commander-in-chief, our Jane Arraf looks at the view from an old adversary.</s>JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a region that understands dynasties, George W. Bush following in his father's footsteps to the White House is no surprise. But in Iraq, the name Bush is synonymous with war. This woman struggles to remember what she was doing in 1991 until a neighbor prompts her: \"the Bush War.\" In the Gulf states, which went to war to free Kuwait, then- President George Bush was a hero. In Iraq, he was a villain, a legacy literally set in stone at Baghdad's government owned Rashid Hotel. The hotel was hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1993 after an alleged Iraqi plot to kill the former U.S. president. (on camera): Iraq denies the plot, but says the United States has been trying to get rid of President Saddam Hussein for years. (voice-over): One familiar face in the new U.S. Cabinet, Gulf War Gen. Colin Powell, is again talking about unfinished business with Iraq.</s>TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: What business does he have with Iraq, you see? If he wants to continue the aggressive policy which the previous administration, in which he was the chief of staff, took against Iraq, it's up to him.</s>ARRAF: Officials are ridiculing plans for increased U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition.</s>AZIZ: Let them spend more money on those crooks. If they have a surplus in the American budget to spend on those people rather than spending it on health care or education in the United States, let them spend that money.</s>ARRAF: Iraq says it doesn't matter to the government here who's in the White House, but the issue is so sensitive it won't let journalists ask Iraqis what they think of the new U.S. president. Iraq, though, will be keeping as much of an eye on the new U.S. administration as the administration is on Iraq. Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green. When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be my queen.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: In the evening, over on the West Coast in Negril, watching the sunset at Rick's cafe is a long-standing tradition.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will drive as far as from Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, which is sometimes three and four hours, to come and see us. We are packed all the time.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: While guests wait for the sun to set, they enjoy some of Rick's Jamaican cuisine and rock to the rhythms of Reggae music. The more daring visitors can dive from cliffs 50-feet high. But the locals outdo them all by climbing even higher and jumping from the trees.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard so much about it. It's everything they say.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: And it Jamaica, the fun doesn't depend on the weather.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen 250 people toast a cloudy, rainy sky at the very moment that the sun should be hitting the horizon.

SHELLEY WALCOTT, CO-HOST: Happy Monday and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Shelley Walcott. A lot ahead today. Here's what's coming up. President Bush hits the ground running his first week in office. We'll take a look at what he's got planned. Then, in \"Environment Desk,\" new homes near Atlanta that could save owners a lot of money. From the suburbs of the U.S. to the wilds of Russia, \"Worldview\" zeros in on the wolf. And in \"Chronicle,\" a high school band in a high-profile performance. The United States presidency changes hands, creating a weekend of beginnings and endings, parties and protests. President George W. Bush was sworn in Saturday as the nation's 43rd president. A controversial yet smooth shift in power this weekend. Former President Clinton bid farewell to a position he's held for eight years, placing his executive responsibilities in the hands of his replacement, President George W. Bush. In his 14-minute inaugural address, President Bush promised to unite America and lead with civility and compassion.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.</s>WALCOTT: A three-hour parade followed the inauguration ceremony and a series of inaugural balls followed that. And while thousands of Americans cheered Mr. Bush on his big day, thousands more protested vigorously, creating what one presidential historian called the largest inaugural protest since Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The upcoming week will be busy for Mr. Bush as he gets down to business on education, the economy and tax cuts. During his first full day in office, President George W. Bush picked up more support for his huge tax cut plan. Mr. Bush is proposing a 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut. Patty Davis has more now on the tax plan and the Democratic senator who's agreed to support it.</s>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his first full day in office, a big boost for President George W. Bush and his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell Miller plans to co-sponsor Bush's tax cut with Republican Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm.</s>ANDREW CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm thrilled if Sen. Gramm has found a Democratic co-sponsor. We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal. Patty Davis, CNN, Capitol Hill.</s>WALCOTT: Cold weather and soaring energy costs. For many Americans this winter, its an expensive combination. Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on. The numbers are huge, 700 Earthcraft homes being built in Atlanta, thousands more similarly green being constructed across the nation. Brian Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.</s>WALCOTT: In \"Worldview\" today, we check out the environment, business and politics. Are world tour takes us to Russia to spotlight religion and a Jewish revival. More from the region as we focus on the call of the wild and wolves. We also journey to Jamaica for a bit of history and culture. But first we focus on Iraq and Kuwait. It was 10 years ago that U.S. President George Bush led an allied attack to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. Now as the son of the former U.S. president becomes commander-in-chief, our Jane Arraf looks at the view from an old adversary.</s>JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a region that understands dynasties, George W. Bush following in his father's footsteps to the White House is no surprise. But in Iraq, the name Bush is synonymous with war. This woman struggles to remember what she was doing in 1991 until a neighbor prompts her: \"the Bush War.\" In the Gulf states, which went to war to free Kuwait, then- President George Bush was a hero. In Iraq, he was a villain, a legacy literally set in stone at Baghdad's government owned Rashid Hotel. The hotel was hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1993 after an alleged Iraqi plot to kill the former U.S. president. (on camera): Iraq denies the plot, but says the United States has been trying to get rid of President Saddam Hussein for years. (voice-over): One familiar face in the new U.S. Cabinet, Gulf War Gen. Colin Powell, is again talking about unfinished business with Iraq.</s>TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: What business does he have with Iraq, you see? If he wants to continue the aggressive policy which the previous administration, in which he was the chief of staff, took against Iraq, it's up to him.</s>ARRAF: Officials are ridiculing plans for increased U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition.</s>AZIZ: Let them spend more money on those crooks. If they have a surplus in the American budget to spend on those people rather than spending it on health care or education in the United States, let them spend that money.</s>ARRAF: Iraq says it doesn't matter to the government here who's in the White House, but the issue is so sensitive it won't let journalists ask Iraqis what they think of the new U.S. president. Iraq, though, will be keeping as much of an eye on the new U.S. administration as the administration is on Iraq. Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green. When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be my queen.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: In the evening, over on the West Coast in Negril, watching the sunset at Rick's cafe is a long-standing tradition.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will drive as far as from Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, which is sometimes three and four hours, to come and see us. We are packed all the time.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: While guests wait for the sun to set, they enjoy some of Rick's Jamaican cuisine and rock to the rhythms of Reggae music. The more daring visitors can dive from cliffs 50-feet high. But the locals outdo them all by climbing even higher and jumping from the trees.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard so much about it. It's everything they say.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: And it Jamaica, the fun doesn't depend on the weather.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen 250 people toast a cloudy, rainy sky at the very moment that the sun should be hitting the horizon. Doesn't matter, man. In Jamaica, everything cool, man.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Negril, Jamaica.</s>TOM HAYNES, CO-HOST: The Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. What remained was Greater Russia and 10 former Soviet republics. After the breakup, Russia claimed those republics to be part of the new commonwealth of independent states. But ethnic disputes soon emerged among those who didn't want to be part of the new Russian federation and tensions ensued. To lend moral guidance, the Russian Orthodox Church reestablished itself after years of communist repression. Since then, other religions have also reemerged. Steve Harrigan reports on a religious homecoming of sorts.</s>STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As newborn baby Mark Segal (ph) and his family left Russia for the United States, Jews in search of religious freedom. Now they've come back to Moscow to celebrate Mark's bar mitzvah.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel it's really like my home.</s>HARRIGAN: A community whose members often tried to hide their identity in the old Soviet Union or emigrate to the West is taking on a new, much more public role at home.</s>BERL LAZAR, CHIEF RABBI OF RUSSIA: The numbers are incredible. Today we believe that we are in touch with over a million Jews.</s>HARRIGAN: Russian President Vladimir Putin helped unveil a $12 million Jewish community center on the same site where a synagogue was bombed twice and burned once in the last 10 years. the ex-KGB colonel called decades of state persecution absurd.</s>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): People were forced to study their own language underground in secret. Who will live in such a country?</s>HARRIGAN: Hebrew lessons are out in the open today, but not all Jews welcome the government's embrace. Rival factions say Russia's new chief rabbi was hand-picked by the Kremlin.</s>PINCHAS GOLDSCHMIDT, CHIEF RABBI OF MOSCOW: We see a very long tradition -- Russian tradition -- not only communist, a very long Russian tradition of trying to control and influence religious groups.</s>HARRIGAN: If that tradition still exists, the methods have certainly changed, from open violence just a few years ago to smiles and handshakes today. Steve Harrigan, CNN, Moscow.</s>RUDI BAKHTIAR, CO-HOST: More from Russia as we turn to the wild kingdom. We look at one of the largest members of the dog family, the wolf. Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others.

SHELLEY WALCOTT, CO-HOST: Happy Monday and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Shelley Walcott. A lot ahead today. Here's what's coming up. President Bush hits the ground running his first week in office. We'll take a look at what he's got planned. Then, in \"Environment Desk,\" new homes near Atlanta that could save owners a lot of money. From the suburbs of the U.S. to the wilds of Russia, \"Worldview\" zeros in on the wolf. And in \"Chronicle,\" a high school band in a high-profile performance. The United States presidency changes hands, creating a weekend of beginnings and endings, parties and protests. President George W. Bush was sworn in Saturday as the nation's 43rd president. A controversial yet smooth shift in power this weekend. Former President Clinton bid farewell to a position he's held for eight years, placing his executive responsibilities in the hands of his replacement, President George W. Bush. In his 14-minute inaugural address, President Bush promised to unite America and lead with civility and compassion.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.</s>WALCOTT: A three-hour parade followed the inauguration ceremony and a series of inaugural balls followed that. And while thousands of Americans cheered Mr. Bush on his big day, thousands more protested vigorously, creating what one presidential historian called the largest inaugural protest since Richard Nixon took office in 1969. The upcoming week will be busy for Mr. Bush as he gets down to business on education, the economy and tax cuts. During his first full day in office, President George W. Bush picked up more support for his huge tax cut plan. Mr. Bush is proposing a 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut. Patty Davis has more now on the tax plan and the Democratic senator who's agreed to support it.</s>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his first full day in office, a big boost for President George W. Bush and his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Georgia Democratic Sen. Zell Miller plans to co-sponsor Bush's tax cut with Republican Senate Banking Chairman Phil Gramm.</s>ANDREW CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I'm thrilled if Sen. Gramm has found a Democratic co-sponsor. We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal. Patty Davis, CNN, Capitol Hill.</s>WALCOTT: Cold weather and soaring energy costs. For many Americans this winter, its an expensive combination. Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on. The numbers are huge, 700 Earthcraft homes being built in Atlanta, thousands more similarly green being constructed across the nation. Brian Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.</s>WALCOTT: In \"Worldview\" today, we check out the environment, business and politics. Are world tour takes us to Russia to spotlight religion and a Jewish revival. More from the region as we focus on the call of the wild and wolves. We also journey to Jamaica for a bit of history and culture. But first we focus on Iraq and Kuwait. It was 10 years ago that U.S. President George Bush led an allied attack to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. Now as the son of the former U.S. president becomes commander-in-chief, our Jane Arraf looks at the view from an old adversary.</s>JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a region that understands dynasties, George W. Bush following in his father's footsteps to the White House is no surprise. But in Iraq, the name Bush is synonymous with war. This woman struggles to remember what she was doing in 1991 until a neighbor prompts her: \"the Bush War.\" In the Gulf states, which went to war to free Kuwait, then- President George Bush was a hero. In Iraq, he was a villain, a legacy literally set in stone at Baghdad's government owned Rashid Hotel. The hotel was hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1993 after an alleged Iraqi plot to kill the former U.S. president. (on camera): Iraq denies the plot, but says the United States has been trying to get rid of President Saddam Hussein for years. (voice-over): One familiar face in the new U.S. Cabinet, Gulf War Gen. Colin Powell, is again talking about unfinished business with Iraq.</s>TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: What business does he have with Iraq, you see? If he wants to continue the aggressive policy which the previous administration, in which he was the chief of staff, took against Iraq, it's up to him.</s>ARRAF: Officials are ridiculing plans for increased U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition.</s>AZIZ: Let them spend more money on those crooks. If they have a surplus in the American budget to spend on those people rather than spending it on health care or education in the United States, let them spend that money.</s>ARRAF: Iraq says it doesn't matter to the government here who's in the White House, but the issue is so sensitive it won't let journalists ask Iraqis what they think of the new U.S. president. Iraq, though, will be keeping as much of an eye on the new U.S. administration as the administration is on Iraq. Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green. When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be my queen.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: In the evening, over on the West Coast in Negril, watching the sunset at Rick's cafe is a long-standing tradition.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will drive as far as from Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, which is sometimes three and four hours, to come and see us. We are packed all the time.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: While guests wait for the sun to set, they enjoy some of Rick's Jamaican cuisine and rock to the rhythms of Reggae music. The more daring visitors can dive from cliffs 50-feet high. But the locals outdo them all by climbing even higher and jumping from the trees.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard so much about it. It's everything they say.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: And it Jamaica, the fun doesn't depend on the weather.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen 250 people toast a cloudy, rainy sky at the very moment that the sun should be hitting the horizon. Doesn't matter, man. In Jamaica, everything cool, man.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Negril, Jamaica.</s>TOM HAYNES, CO-HOST: The Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. What remained was Greater Russia and 10 former Soviet republics. After the breakup, Russia claimed those republics to be part of the new commonwealth of independent states. But ethnic disputes soon emerged among those who didn't want to be part of the new Russian federation and tensions ensued. To lend moral guidance, the Russian Orthodox Church reestablished itself after years of communist repression. Since then, other religions have also reemerged. Steve Harrigan reports on a religious homecoming of sorts.</s>STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As newborn baby Mark Segal (ph) and his family left Russia for the United States, Jews in search of religious freedom. Now they've come back to Moscow to celebrate Mark's bar mitzvah.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel it's really like my home.</s>HARRIGAN: A community whose members often tried to hide their identity in the old Soviet Union or emigrate to the West is taking on a new, much more public role at home.</s>BERL LAZAR, CHIEF RABBI OF RUSSIA: The numbers are incredible. Today we believe that we are in touch with over a million Jews.</s>HARRIGAN: Russian President Vladimir Putin helped unveil a $12 million Jewish community center on the same site where a synagogue was bombed twice and burned once in the last 10 years. the ex-KGB colonel called decades of state persecution absurd.</s>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): People were forced to study their own language underground in secret. Who will live in such a country?</s>HARRIGAN: Hebrew lessons are out in the open today, but not all Jews welcome the government's embrace. Rival factions say Russia's new chief rabbi was hand-picked by the Kremlin.</s>PINCHAS GOLDSCHMIDT, CHIEF RABBI OF MOSCOW: We see a very long tradition -- Russian tradition -- not only communist, a very long Russian tradition of trying to control and influence religious groups.</s>HARRIGAN: If that tradition still exists, the methods have certainly changed, from open violence just a few years ago to smiles and handshakes today. Steve Harrigan, CNN, Moscow.</s>RUDI BAKHTIAR, CO-HOST: More from Russia as we turn to the wild kingdom. We look at one of the largest members of the dog family, the wolf. Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others. Gary Strieker, CNN, Bordanesz (ph), Russia.</s>WALCOTT: Well, it was a big weekend for the new U.S. president. The inauguration didn't stop at President Bush's swearing-in. The rest of the day included a parade, a church service, and parties, parties, parties. We sent our Washington NEWSROOM correspondent Mike McManus to the inaugural balls to find out what the young people hope can be accomplished in this new administration.</s>MIKE MCMANUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Bush's inauguration speech centered on an issue familiar with his campaign.</s>BUSH: Our unity, our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.</s>MCMANUS: Fritz Brogan is a 16-year-old very familiar with the issue.</s>FRITZ BROGAN, AGE 16: It's time to celebrate. It's been a long and arduous race, but it's over.</s>MCMANUS: He's from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ground zero in the election recount. Brogan celebrated inauguration night in the nation's capital at the Florida inaugural ball.</s>BROGAN: A lot of people's toes were stepped over during the election. Many people thought that their right to vote was sacrificed. But I think, together, George W. Bush can do a great job of bringing America back together.</s>MCMANUS: Brogan is a Bush supporter and was active in his campaign for president. The high school sophomore even started his own Web site specifically for teenagers interested in the Bush-Cheney ticket.</s>BROGAN: The Internet's the one thing that unites youth. Pretty much everyone out there has a computer and e-mail address, so I was able to contact kids from across the country, even across the world.</s>MCMANUS (on camera): Bringing two deeply divided political parties together may be top on the president's list. But as with any leader, success will not be measured by promises. Young voters are looking for results. Are you going to hold him to those promises?</s>BROGAN: I will hold him to his promises, yes.</s>MCMANUS (voice-over): Other young partygoers were more interested in the new president's campaign promise of reforming the U.S. education system.</s>BUSH: Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.</s>KATELIN SULLIVAN, AGE 18: Every student should have the opportunity to attend whatever school is the best for them, fits them the best, their style of learning.</s>JAMIE BLOSSER, AGE 16: I like his point about not leaving anyone behind. Every child should get an education no matter, you know, if they're rich or poor and where they live. I think that's so important.</s>MCMANUS: Another point of interest was President Bush's thoughts on the slowing economy.</s>BUSH: We will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.</s>CHRIS ROOD, AGE 21: It's important to me because I -- so I have a job when I'm older, you know, keep a job and have a family.</s>MCMANUS: These young people assembled for the inauguration said they were excited about ideas the new administration bring to Washington, but also know there are challenges ahead for Both 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill. President Bush echoed those challenges at the end of his speech.</s>BUSH: This work continues, the story goes on...</s>MCMANUS: Michael McManus, CNN NEWSROOM, Washington.</s>WALCOTT: With all the pomp and ceremony we see on TV surrounding a presidential inaugural, you can imagine the excitement of actually attending one. But what if you're in the high school band and the Presidential Inaugural Committee asks you to perform for the new president? Our Jason Bellini reports the words \"excitement\" and, yes, \"nervousness\" take on a whole new meaning.</s>JASON BELLINI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the bands marching in the inaugural parade, the day started early in a parking lot at the Pentagon. Thirty high school and college bands were chosen by the Inaugural Committee for the honor of performing for the new president. I followed through the day a band from Papillion-LaVista High School in Omaha, Nebraska. If you're a band that made it all the way to here, you know that you're among the best of the best. So as bands were warming up, they checked out one another. The band travelled 25 hours to get to Washington, D.C., most not sleeping very much along the way.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to be going over to the National Mall.</s>BELLINI: With over 70 members, they were a handful for their band director.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whatever I tell you to do, we need to do right away, OK? Any questions at all?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Keller (ph), I got a question. Do you know where the Pepsi band is staying?</s>BELLINI (on camera): How are these kids behaving?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Excellent.</s>BELLINI: Yes?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Excellent. You bet. Couldn't be better.</s>BELLINI: No tomfoolery on the bus?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, none whatsoever, no, no.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh God, no! Oh God, no!</s>BELLINI: You wouldn't tolerate that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, exactly.</s>BELLINI (voice-over): 11:00 a.m., the bus left the Pentagon, driving to the Mall. Security extraordinarily tight for the parade, police blocked off streets for the convoy of band buses.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you know really if we just like ran a red light?</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, this is tight.</s>BELLINI: Most of the band saw through their bus windows their nation's capital for the very first time.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought I was never going to see the White House.</s>BELLINI: No one informed them beforehand that the Mall didn't have a Gap or Bloomingdale's.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was so ready to go shopping.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's a mall?</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were going shopping. No, there's no mall.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you joking?</s>BELLINI: Their coming here wasn't just a big event for them and their parents, but also for the community back home.

That is the cutest thing.</s>BELLINI: Around 11:50 a.m., the inaugural ceremony began. The bus driver turned the radio to it.

We expect a lot of Democrats to support our plan because it's the right thing for America.</s>DAVIS: Miller's spokeswoman said, quote, \"He campaigned on the fact that he wanted to be bipartisan, and he wanted to be a tax- cutting senator just as he was a tax-cutting governor, and this is a great opportunity to do both.\" Miller, a Southern moderate, was the first Democrat to say he'd vote for John Ashcroft, President Bush's controversial nominee for attorney general. The bipartisanship on one of Mr. Bush's top priorities could help the new president has he begins to push his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill.</s>STUART ROTHENBERG, ROTHENBERG POLITICAL REPORT: George W. Bush has made a big deal about reaching out, and this is the first success. This is the -- a Democrat is now onboard the tax proposal, and it suggest other opportunities for Bush, and it suggests that Bush has some appeal to Democrats.</s>DAVIS: But Bush's tax plan still has a long way to go. Democrats say it would outspend the budget surplus.</s>SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MINORITY LEADER: Whether it's divided in pieces or offered in its entirety, I think the key question is, what is the entire package cost. We can't afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut that we don't have the resources for that.</s>DAVIS (on camera): The new president will have to woo Democrats. And he may not get his entire plan through the closely divided Congress. Now, though, he's one Democrat closer to his goal.

Heating bills can soar into the hundreds of dollars each month and not everyone can afford to keep their home as warm as they'd like. Now some homebuilders near Atlanta, Georgia are constructing houses to combat the elements, homes that will help stave off heat during the summer months and keep the cold air at bay during the winter. Brian Cabell reports on this initiative.</s>BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are five so- called \"Earthcraft\" houses being built near Atlanta; homes that are environmentally friendly and guaranteed to save owners up to $100 or more a month on energy costs. Sure, most have energy-efficient appliances, the washer, dryer, dishwasher and air conditioning units. But at least equally important, builders say, is the way the house is constructed, with heavy-duty insulation, mastic to seal leaks on ducts, sealed light fixtures, rubber seals around doors.</s>JIM HACKLER, EARTHCRAFT HOUSE PROGRAM: Typically on most homes, and this is even new homes, that a third of your heating and cooling costs are lost because of leakage.</s>CABELL: One other vital component these homes feature to prevent leakage: double pane windows with a special glass that deflects some of the sunlight. All this adds to the cost of the homes, maybe 2 percent at most, but designers say it's well worth it in the long run.</s>TOM FALIK, HOMEBUILDER: So the overall cost of one to 1 to 1 1/2 percent is amortized very easily by the energy savings that the homeowner will have over the first couple of years of the house.</s>CABELL: Are home shoppers ready for more energy-efficient and slightly more expensive houses? Clearly some are.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did buy a solar home and paid extra, and have enjoyed it thoroughly.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up front, it's all done at once. And if you tried to add it later, it's going to be far more expense than it would be if you did it in the beginning.</s>CABELL: That's the attitude homebuilders are counting on.

It was 10 years ago that U.S. President George Bush led an allied attack to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. Now as the son of the former U.S. president becomes commander-in-chief, our Jane Arraf looks at the view from an old adversary.</s>JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a region that understands dynasties, George W. Bush following in his father's footsteps to the White House is no surprise. But in Iraq, the name Bush is synonymous with war. This woman struggles to remember what she was doing in 1991 until a neighbor prompts her: \"the Bush War.\" In the Gulf states, which went to war to free Kuwait, then- President George Bush was a hero. In Iraq, he was a villain, a legacy literally set in stone at Baghdad's government owned Rashid Hotel. The hotel was hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1993 after an alleged Iraqi plot to kill the former U.S. president. (on camera): Iraq denies the plot, but says the United States has been trying to get rid of President Saddam Hussein for years. (voice-over): One familiar face in the new U.S. Cabinet, Gulf War Gen. Colin Powell, is again talking about unfinished business with Iraq.</s>TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: What business does he have with Iraq, you see? If he wants to continue the aggressive policy which the previous administration, in which he was the chief of staff, took against Iraq, it's up to him.</s>ARRAF: Officials are ridiculing plans for increased U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition.</s>AZIZ: Let them spend more money on those crooks. If they have a surplus in the American budget to spend on those people rather than spending it on health care or education in the United States, let them spend that money.</s>ARRAF: Iraq says it doesn't matter to the government here who's in the White House, but the issue is so sensitive it won't let journalists ask Iraqis what they think of the new U.S. president. Iraq, though, will be keeping as much of an eye on the new U.S. administration as the administration is on Iraq. Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green.

What remained was Greater Russia and 10 former Soviet republics. After the breakup, Russia claimed those republics to be part of the new commonwealth of independent states. But ethnic disputes soon emerged among those who didn't want to be part of the new Russian federation and tensions ensued. To lend moral guidance, the Russian Orthodox Church reestablished itself after years of communist repression. Since then, other religions have also reemerged. Steve Harrigan reports on a religious homecoming of sorts.</s>STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As newborn baby Mark Segal (ph) and his family left Russia for the United States, Jews in search of religious freedom.

Steve Harrigan, CNN, Moscow.</s>RUDI BAKHTIAR, CO-HOST: More from Russia as we turn to the wild kingdom. We look at one of the largest members of the dog family, the wolf. Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others.

Jane Arraf, CNN, Baghdad.</s>WALCOTT: We open our eyes now to the natural beauty of Jamaica, an island nation in the West Indies. Located 480 miles or 772 kilometers south of Florida, Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital and largest city, Kingston, serves as the country's chief port. Jamaica was a British colony for about 300 years, becoming an independent nation in 1962. The island's economy thrives on production of bauxite, bananas, sugar and other manufactured goods. But tourism is also an economic cornerstone. Jamaica's pleasant climates and beautiful beaches attract more than 850,000 visitors each year. Kalin Thomas-Samuel tells us why.</s>KALIN THOMAS-SAMUEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jamaica's lush landscape is filled with challenges for the adventurous traveler. One of the island's most popular attractions, Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios. You don't just look at these waterfalls, you climb them. About 2,500 tourists a day take on the challenge of 600 feet of slippery rocks. Many visitors come from cruise ships.</s>MERLE WILSON, MANAGER DUNN'S RIVER FALLS & PARK: It is a good thing for Jamaica. Tourism is our major foreign exchange arena. So cruise ship visitors are very special to Dunn's River because we're really the reason why they come here.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: People of all ages make the trek. All you need is an experienced guide, the right shoes, a bathing suit or lightweight clothing and a sense of adventure. There are a few breaks along the way for taking pictures, and just about everybody makes it to the top.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Scary, but it was very great.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Dunn's River Falls, I love Jamaica.</s>WILSON: I am sometimes surprised when I see some persons climbing the falls because all the falls different sizes. It's a very exhilarating experience, one like that.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (on camera): Now, if you're not quite ready for the rushing waters of Dunn's River Falls, there are more peaceful waters. Here in Montego Bay, the Martha Brae River allows you to sit back and enjoy the view. (voice-over): This gentle waterway takes its name from an Arawak Indian who refused to reveal the location of a gold mine to Spanish invaders. Legend says she drowned herself in this river and took the Spaniards with her. Drowning in fun and relaxation is the theme these days. Tour guides, or captains, as they're called, add to the experience by offering tidbits about Jamaican history and culture; for instance, explaining how Jamaicans use the leaves of a pimento tree.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have an upset stomach, you just chew on the leaf.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: We drift by a souvenir stand and stop for a refreshing drink of coconut water. Jamaicans say it cleanses the body. You can even buy a souvenir made right on the raft. (on camera): Where'd you learn to do that?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just right here on the job.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: On the river?</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL (voice-over): A serenade is a nice finishing touch towards the end of the trip.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (singing): Lavender blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green. When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be my queen.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: In the evening, over on the West Coast in Negril, watching the sunset at Rick's cafe is a long-standing tradition.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will drive as far as from Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, which is sometimes three and four hours, to come and see us. We are packed all the time.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: While guests wait for the sun to set, they enjoy some of Rick's Jamaican cuisine and rock to the rhythms of Reggae music. The more daring visitors can dive from cliffs 50-feet high. But the locals outdo them all by climbing even higher and jumping from the trees.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard so much about it. It's everything they say.</s>THOMAS-SAMUEL: And it Jamaica, the fun doesn't depend on the weather.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've seen 250 people toast a cloudy, rainy sky at the very moment that the sun should be hitting the horizon.

What remained was Greater Russia and 10 former Soviet republics. After the breakup, Russia claimed those republics to be part of the new commonwealth of independent states. But ethnic disputes soon emerged among those who didn't want to be part of the new Russian federation and tensions ensued. To lend moral guidance, the Russian Orthodox Church reestablished itself after years of communist repression. Since then, other religions have also reemerged. Steve Harrigan reports on a religious homecoming of sorts.</s>STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As newborn baby Mark Segal (ph) and his family left Russia for the United States, Jews in search of religious freedom. Now they've come back to Moscow to celebrate Mark's bar mitzvah.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel it's really like my home.</s>HARRIGAN: A community whose members often tried to hide their identity in the old Soviet Union or emigrate to the West is taking on a new, much more public role at home.</s>BERL LAZAR, CHIEF RABBI OF RUSSIA: The numbers are incredible.

Who will live in such a country?</s>HARRIGAN: Hebrew lessons are out in the open today, but not all Jews welcome the government's embrace. Rival factions say Russia's new chief rabbi was hand-picked by the Kremlin.</s>PINCHAS GOLDSCHMIDT, CHIEF RABBI OF MOSCOW: We see a very long tradition -- Russian tradition -- not only communist, a very long Russian tradition of trying to control and influence religious groups.</s>HARRIGAN: If that tradition still exists, the methods have certainly changed, from open violence just a few years ago to smiles and handshakes today. Steve Harrigan, CNN, Moscow.</s>RUDI BAKHTIAR, CO-HOST: More from Russia as we turn to the wild kingdom. We look at one of the largest members of the dog family, the wolf. Wolves typically live in sparsely populated northern regions such as Alaska, China and Russia. They're experts at hunting, preying mainly on large animals, including deer, elk and moose. Wolves resemble large German shepherd dogs in appearance. Their fur ranges from pure white in the Arctic to jet black in the subarctic forests. These predators live in groups called packs, which have anywhere from eight to 20 members. The packs social order involves a dominant hierarchy in which each wolf holds a certain rank. High- ranking called dominant wolves dominate low-ranking members, or subordinate wolves. But high rankings aren't enough to protect these animals from human predators. Gary Strieker explains.</s>GARY STRIEKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his backyard, Mikhail Stardadupsev (ph) has a few orphans: five wolf pups he found in a den when they were only a few days old. He likes to give them his dog to play with, though the dog seems to know the wolves would probably eat him if they were a bit older. Mikhail has been a forest ranger in southwestern Russia for more than 50 years. And he says he likes wolves, but he admits he's killed many of them in his time, including the mother of these pups. He's got a small wolf exhibit in his tool shed, a kind of testimonial to his affection for these animals. He says \"the wolf is like a sanitary cleaner in the forest preying on sick and weak animals. It's necessary to have them around,\" he says, \"but when there are too many, some of them must be killed.\" That's been the policy in Russia for hundreds of years. Killing wolves allows prey animals like deer and wild boar to multiply. And that's what human hunters want. The government still pays a bounty to anyone who kills a wolf outside protected reserves. But officials in Moscow say there are still too many wolves in Russia; at last count more than 44,000 of them across the country. Nearly 13,000 wolves were killed last year alone. But officials claim that's not enough to keep them under control. They say there's no money for the transport, fuel and weapons to do the job. But there's a growing movement in Russia, influenced by new ecological thinking in the West, that would give a greater role to wolves in these forests, allowing a natural balance between wolves and their prey. But wildlife biologist Andre Poyarkov (ph) says many Russians are still deeply afraid of wolves, and he expects the annual wolf kills will continue, even increase. Mikhail says he'll release these wolves back to the forest, where they'll have to take their chances against bounty hunters like all the others.

Many people thought that their right to vote was sacrificed. But I think, together, George W. Bush can do a great job of bringing America back together.</s>MCMANUS: Brogan is a Bush supporter and was active in his campaign for president. The high school sophomore even started his own Web site specifically for teenagers interested in the Bush-Cheney ticket.</s>BROGAN: The Internet's the one thing that unites youth. Pretty much everyone out there has a computer and e-mail address, so I was able to contact kids from across the country, even across the world.</s>MCMANUS (on camera): Bringing two deeply divided political parties together may be top on the president's list. But as with any leader, success will not be measured by promises. Young voters are looking for results. Are you going to hold him to those promises?</s>BROGAN: I will hold him to his promises, yes.</s>MCMANUS (voice-over): Other young partygoers were more interested in the new president's campaign promise of reforming the U.S. education system.</s>BUSH: Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.</s>KATELIN SULLIVAN, AGE 18: Every student should have the opportunity to attend whatever school is the best for them, fits them the best, their style of learning.</s>JAMIE BLOSSER, AGE 16: I like his point about not leaving anyone behind.

Our Jason Bellini reports the words \"excitement\" and, yes, \"nervousness\" take on a whole new meaning.</s>JASON BELLINI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the bands marching in the inaugural parade, the day started early in a parking lot at the Pentagon. Thirty high school and college bands were chosen by the Inaugural Committee for the honor of performing for the new president. I followed through the day a band from Papillion-LaVista High School in Omaha, Nebraska. If you're a band that made it all the way to here, you know that you're among the best of the best. So as bands were warming up, they checked out one another. The band travelled 25 hours to get to Washington, D.C., most not sleeping very much along the way.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to be going over to the National Mall.</s>BELLINI: With over 70 members, they were a handful for their band director.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whatever I tell you to do, we need to do right away, OK?

That is the cutest thing.</s>BELLINI: Around 11:50 a.m., the inaugural ceremony began. The bus driver turned the radio to it. From the bus to a holding tent next for hot chocolate and more time to mingle with the other bands.

HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

{"uid": "MSumBench_1398", "dataset": "pubmed", "domain": "medical_literature", "doc_id": "PMC3124316", "summary_model": "csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum", "input_text": "高血压（Hypertension, HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

{"uid": "MSumBench_1399", "dataset": "pubmed", "domain": "medical_literature", "doc_id": "PMC3124316", "summary_model": "google/gemma-2-27b-it", "input_text": "高血压（Hypertension, HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

{"uid": "MSumBench_1400", "dataset": "pubmed", "domain": "medical_literature", "doc_id": "PMC3124316", "summary_model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "input_text": "高血压（Hypertension, HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

{"uid": "MSumBench_1401", "dataset": "pubmed", "domain": "medical_literature", "doc_id": "PMC3124316", "summary_model": "models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest", "input_text": "高血压（Hypertension, HTN）是全球最常见的合并症，对公共健康具有重要影响 [1, 2]。\n在2005年至2008年间，美国18岁及以上成人高血压的总体患病率为30.9%，其中65岁及以上人群（69.7%）和非西班牙裔黑人（44%）患病率最高。\n美国心脏协会估计，高血压每年造成的费用超过935亿美元，而高血压是主要危险因素的心血管疾病和中风占美国年度医疗支出的17%。\n高血压及其后遗症心力衰竭（Heart Failure, HF）是一种进展性疾病。\n证据显示，心力衰竭患者在确诊后五年存活率不足一半，十年存活率不足四分之一。\nFramingham心脏研究显示，与血压正常者相比，高血压患者更易发生心力衰竭（随访前16年中检测到142例心力衰竭）。\n血压（BP）> 160/90 mmHg的人发生心力衰竭的终生风险是血压< 140/90 mmHg者的两倍。\n与最常见的性别相关恶性肿瘤（男性的肠癌和女性的乳腺癌）相比，心力衰竭的长期生存率更低。\n每年因心力衰竭住院的病例超过百万，导致超过25万例死亡，并导致医疗费用的激增达到数十亿美元，这是普遍现象。\n应认识到高血压和心力衰竭这一灾难性组合，并应为特殊人群，尤其是高风险的少数族裔群体（如负担过重的黑人）制定针对性管理措施。\n在各种族群体中，非裔美国成年人患高血压的比例最高（44%），且对治疗更具抵抗性。\n尤其是，黑人女性的患病率最高，血压控制率最低。\n非裔美国人发生心力衰竭的相对发生率高出50%，其中3%的非裔美国人患有心力衰竭，而普通人群的比例为2% [13, 14]。\n这种疾病发病年龄更早，通常伴随更晚期的病程，住院率和死亡率增加。\n心力衰竭的其他原因包括冠状动脉疾病、心瓣膜病、糖尿病、左心室肥厚和心肌病。\n由舒张性左心室功能障碍引起的明显临床心力衰竭在临床上可能与由收缩性功能障碍引起的心力衰竭无法区分。\n左心室功能保留的心力衰竭在30%至50%的成年心力衰竭病例中观察到。\n冠状动脉疾病和心肌梗死是收缩性左心室功能障碍的主要原因，其次是高血压。\n多种神经激素系统，尤其是肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统和交感神经系统，在左心室功能障碍时被激活，这种激活导致异常的心室重构。\n通过神经激素阻断疗法，包括血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ACEIs）、β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BBs）和醛固酮拮抗剂，可显著减少左心室功能障碍向更严重阶段的不可逆进展。\n目前对心力衰竭病理生理机制的理解集中于神经激素激活 [19, 20]。\n这种内皮功能障碍可能由一氧化氮（Nitric Oxide, NO）不足引起，这种不足可能是由于内皮NO生成减少或NO失活增加所致 [17, 19, 21]。\n在心力衰竭中，白人表现出血管紧张素II显著增加，而NO略有减少。\n然而，患有心力衰竭的非裔美国人可能表现出更大的NO减少；相比之下，白人血管紧张素II的升高可能较少。\n重要研究正在探讨可能影响高血压及其并发症风险的种族间基因变异，例如编码β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因中的单核苷酸多态性。\n在β1-肾上腺素能受体和α2c-肾上腺素能受体基因多态性中具有纯合基因型的非裔美国人患心力衰竭的风险高出10倍，而这一情况在非裔美国人中表现尤为显著。\n转化生长因子-1（Transforming Growth Factor-1, TGF-1）过表达的群体，其预后较差。TGF-1是一种涉及心脏纤维化和重构、血管和肾脏疾病、血管收缩因子内皮素-1生成以及肾素释放刺激的细胞因子。\n非裔美国人中可能影响心力衰竭风险的其他基因多态性包括内皮一氧化氮合酶、醛固酮合酶生成的升高以及G蛋白825-T等位基因。\n对患者心力衰竭阶段或临床严重程度的分类有两种主要方法。\n最常见的是纽约心脏协会（New York Heart Association, NYHA）分类，主要基于功能容量和症状严重程度的主观评估。\n这一分类具有流动性，其分级会根据患者的主观评估和临床状态在同一患者中波动。\n另一种方法由美国心脏病学会/美国心脏协会（American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association, ACC/AHA）指南采用，强调疾病的进展性。\n将其分为A、B、C和D阶段，每个阶段都有明确的特征和推荐的干预措施。\n为了强调心力衰竭的进展性及预防其发展或进展至终末期疾病（D阶段）的必要性[18, 23]，当前心力衰竭指南将A阶段患者定义为无结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状但有心力衰竭风险增加者。\nA阶段代表了一个至关重要的群体，因为许多危险因素，包括高血压，可以被有效控制，从而可能预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病的发生。\nB阶段患者是指有结构性心脏病证据但无当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nC阶段是指存在结构性心脏病及当前或既往心力衰竭症状者。\nD阶段患者是指需要频繁住院和专业干预的难治性心力衰竭患者。\n多项研究表明，高血压治疗在预防心力衰竭方面具有疗效 [24-27]。\n高血压治疗可将心力衰竭的发生率降低约50%。\n近年来，在提高对血压的认知、治疗和控制方面取得了显著进展。\n多项大型随机临床试验表明，特定类别的药物对心力衰竭患者具有降低死亡率的益处 [28-34]。\n在最新的成人心力衰竭诊断和管理指南中，美国心脏病学基金会（American College of Cardiology Foundation, ACCF）/美国心脏协会（AHA）认识到对特殊人群提出具体建议的必要性。\n生活方式的改变已被证明可以降低血压、提高药物疗效并减少心血管风险。\n高血压的长期初级预防包括减轻超重/肥胖个体的体重。\n减重干预与36个月内高血压发生率降低21%相关。\n饮食措施包括将膳食钠摄入量降低至<1.5克氯化钠 [3, 36]、减少钾、镁和饱和脂肪摄入、增加钙摄入、减少酒精摄入，这些在黑人中表现出更显著的血压降低效果。\n当这些措施与全面的教育和咨询结合时，效果最为显著 [39, 40]。\n运动训练，包括每天进行至少30分钟的有氧体力活动（大多数天），已被证明可减少因缺血性心脏病导致左心室功能障碍患者的复发性心脏事件，并建议在密切的医疗监督下进行。\n应实施文化敏感的干预模式，以帮助指导特殊人群更好地遵守治疗性生活方式改变（Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, TLC） [43, 44]。\n尽管生活方式改变，大多数高血压患者仍需药物治疗以更好地控制血压。\n在美国，高血压的药物治疗在结构性心脏病或心力衰竭症状出现之前主要基于预防终末器官损害的研究。\n推荐特定类别的药物用于B-D阶段的患者，这些药物在减少死亡率和住院次数方面显示出益处。\n读者应参考主要指南，以获取普通人群心力衰竭治疗的完整推荐 [18, 23, 46]。\n然而，心力衰竭高风险的少数族裔在大多数临床试验中仍然代表性不足。\n根据Mitchell等最近的一篇论文《非裔美国人心力衰竭治疗——行动呼吁》，大多数可用证据基于这些试验中非裔美国人有限的代表性或事后分析的有限证据。\n这些论文再次总结了非裔美国人心力衰竭管理的可用证据，并呼吁针对这些高风险人群进行更多治疗试验。\n非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（African American Heart Failure Trial, A-HEFT）是首个专注于非裔美国人群的心力衰竭大型试验，其证据约占所有心力衰竭试验中非裔美国人研究总数的50%。\n这是一项固定剂量硝酸异山梨酯/肼屈嗪（Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine, ISDN/HYD）的随机安慰剂对照双盲研究（图2）。\n为了总结现有治疗的疗效，Psaty等人的数据库包括来自42项试验的192,478名患者，这些试验随机分为7种治疗策略（包括安慰剂）。\n低剂量利尿剂被证明是预防包括心力衰竭在内的心血管疾病和死亡率的最有效一线治疗。\nALLHAT试验表明，利尿剂在预防包括心力衰竭（HF）在内的心血管疾病结局方面，与钙通道阻滞剂或血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂（ACEI）一样有效。\nALLHAT研究还表明，噻嗪类利尿剂治疗对预防疾病进展有益。\n尽管ALLHAT试验和其他试验证明利尿剂是抗高血压治疗的一线药物，也是目前最常开具的抗高血压药物，但这一观点受到最近发表于《美国心脏病学会杂志》（JACC）和欧洲高血压学会会议上研究的挑战。\n然而，ALLHAT试验中使用的利尿剂是长效噻嗪类药物氯噻酮（已被证明可有效降低血压并改善生存率），而不是最常用的抗高血压噻嗪类药物12.5-25毫克的氢氯噻嗪（HCTZ）。\n纽约圣卢克罗斯福医院分析了18项关于HCTZ的试验，发现每天12.5至25毫克这一常用剂量的HCTZ降压效果始终低于大多数其他抗高血压药物。\n利尿剂作为非裔美国人一线治疗的另一个局限性不仅在于疗效不足，还包括多种副作用，如糖尿病、电解质异常和尿毒症等。\n然而，利尿剂在与神经激素（肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮轴）阻断联合治疗时以及在有明确适应症时仍有作用。\n根据国际黑人高血压协会（ISHB）的最新共识声明，氯噻酮……\n此外，ISHB共识声明强调，血压高于目标值（SBP/DBP15/10）的患者（目标血压<130/80），无论是否存在终末器官损害（如心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、肾脏疾病），都应至少接受联合药物治疗。\n使用β受体阻滞剂（Beta Blockers, BB）作为高血压治疗受到质疑。\n一项针对13项试验的荟萃分析（涉及105,951名患者）表明，阿替洛尔在改善中风和心血管事件结局方面无显著效果。\n在B阶段充血性心力衰竭（NYHA I级），定义为无其他症状但左心室射血分数（LVEF）<40%的情况下，推荐使用ACEI和BB。\nIII）左心室功能障碍和明显症状的表现；在这些患者中，也推荐使用ACEI和BB。\n临床研究表明，BBs在心力衰竭中具有降低发病率和死亡率、改善心力衰竭症状的作用，因此也被推荐。\n醛固酮拮抗剂可为重度左心室功能障碍患者（通常为C阶段晚期，NYHA III级）提供额外益处。\n低剂量螺内酯（每天12.5-25毫克）加入标准治疗时可将死亡率降低34%。\n在依普利酮急性心肌梗死后心力衰竭疗效和生存研究（EPHESUS）中，依普利酮使近期心肌梗死后LVEF<40%的患者死亡率降低了15%，其中90%患者有心力衰竭症状。\n血清肌酐<2.5 mg/dl和高钾血症患者被排除在外。\nV-HEFT I和II是比较不同血管扩张剂与安慰剂及彼此之间的大规模试验。\nV-HEFT I显示，与加用地高辛和利尿剂治疗的哌唑嗪或安慰剂组相比，接受ISDN/HYD治疗组（包括非裔美国人和白人）总死亡率显著降低（图1）。\n在V-HEFT II中，尽管ISBD/HYD在降低死亡率方面统计学上劣于依那普利，但服用ISBD/HYD的患者在V-HEFT II中的死亡率与V-HEFT I中服用ISBD/HYD的患者相似。\nV-HEFT I的事后分析显示，ISBD/HYD显著降低了非裔美国患者的死亡率，但对白人患者无显著效果。\n对V-HEFT II的再分析显示，接受ISBD/HYD治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.9%，而接受依那普利治疗的非裔美国患者的年死亡率为12.8%。\n由于V-HEFT中非裔美国人结局的差异，设计了非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）的确证性研究。\n由于接受组合治疗（ISDN/HYD）的患者与安慰剂组相比死亡率显著降低（43%），A-HEFT试验提前结束。\n建议将固定剂量的ISDN/HYD（20 mg/37.5 mg）组合加入包括ACEI和BBs的心力衰竭标准治疗方案中，以改善自述为非裔美国人、NYHA功能分级III或IV级CHF患者的预后。\n此外，来自非裔美国人心力衰竭试验（A-HEFT）中GRAHF（非裔美国人心力衰竭遗传风险评估）分支的基因组证据表明，具有醛固酮合酶基因（CYP11B2）更常见TT表型（61%）的黑人对硝酸异山梨酯和肼屈嗪的组合反应更好。\n绝大多数黑人高血压患者没有明确的病因。\n过去关于病理生理机制的研究显示出矛盾的信息，需要进一步研究以探讨其复杂的关系和相互作用。\n然而，黑人中有几种突出的继发性高血压形式是可以预防的。\n我们将重点讨论最常见、可预防和可治疗的继发性高血压形式——阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（Obstructive Sleep Apnea, OSA）。\n高血压人群中OSA的患病率估计为30-40%，心力衰竭患者中为53%；呼吸暂停-低通气指数（Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI）≥10次/小时。\nOSA是高血压、血压非下降型和血压变异性增加的独立危险因素，并呈剂量依赖关系。\n一项前瞻性研究表明，与AHI=0者相比，AHI≥15次/小时者在48年内发生高血压的可能性高2.89倍，与已知混杂因素无关。\n横断面数据显示，与OSA相关的心力衰竭发生可能性增加2.38倍，与混杂因素无关（n=6424） [67, 68]。\n研究表明，OSA通过多种机制（独立于血压）促进左心室（LV）肥厚、舒张和收缩功能障碍以及明显的心力衰竭。\n这些机制包括左心室壁压力反复增加的血流动力学后果，以及随时间推移心率调节受损，导致LV肥厚和心室重构。\n此外，没有明显心力衰竭的OSA患者比非OSA患者的舒张期松弛更受损。\n新兴证据表明，OSA患者比无该病的患者表现出更活跃的动脉粥样硬化病变，血管受累程度更高，斑块更易破裂，导致更大的心血管负担。\n阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSA）的明确治疗为长期坚持持续气道正压通气（CPAP）疗法，该疗法已被证明能够抑制交感神经活动、降低血压、减少右心室容量并改善心力衰竭患者的收缩功能。\n系统综述、荟萃分析和随机对照试验表明，CPAP疗法可显著降低血压，尤其是在呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）事件增加的患者中 [78-83]。\nDurn-Cantolla等最近的一项为期3年的研究（n = 340）报告称，接受3个月CPAP治疗的参与者的24小时平均动态血压收缩压降低2.1 mmHg（0.4至3.7 mmHg，p = 0.01），舒张压降低1.3 mmHg（0.2至2.3 mmHg，p = 0.02）。\n随机试验的类似证据显示，接受13个月CPAP治疗的患者左心室射血分数（LVEF）提高最多达9%，生活质量（QOL）和功能能力也有所改善。\n此外，在没有明显心力衰竭的患者中，CPAP疗法已被证明能够逆转受损的舒张期松弛。\n需要在高风险少数族裔，尤其是黑人中进行更多随机临床试验，以评估OSA治疗是否具有类似的长期效果，并评估其对高血压和心力衰竭发病率及死亡率的影响。\n考虑到生活方式和药物干预，我们不断变化的医疗社区需要强调医患关系的重要性，并建立信任与合作。\n过去，这通过提高医生、患者、家属和其他护理人员的意识，增加医护人员和患者的教育，以及建立社区外展项目来实现。\n这些措施有助于提高依从性并降低住院风险 [23, 87]。\n我们建议进一步强调与初级保健提供者合作，在心力衰竭患者中实施专科护理。\n过去50年中心力衰竭和高血压管理的显著改善，使我们能够开始针对特定人群提供更多基于证据的治疗，从而改善死亡率。\n黑人（一个多样且异质化的人群）与白人之间在高血压的患病率、治疗和控制，以及心力衰竭的发病率、患病率和死亡率方面存在差异。\n管理团队需要考虑新的证据并制定针对性的治疗策略，特别是针对高血压这一心力衰竭及许多其他心血管并发症的主要原因之一。",

"在大多数情况下，非公民必须是合法永久居民（LPR）才能加入美国武装部队。\n《移民和国籍法》（INA）的特别条款授权现役及最近退役的军人申请入籍。\n符合条件的军队服役包括在美国陆军、海军、海军陆战队、空军、海岸警卫队的现役或预备役服役，或在国民警卫队服役。\n在和平时期荣誉服役美国武装部队一年的人可能有资格申请入籍。\n此外，在指定的战争时期，如第一次世界大战、第二次世界大战以及当前的全球反恐战争中，美国武装部队现役或精选预备役成员如果荣誉服役，可以无需满足最低服役时间要求而申请入籍。\n国防部（DOD）通过认证N-426表格《军事或海军服役认证申请》或签发DD-214表格《现役服役释放或退役证明》、NGB-22表格《国民警卫队退役与服役记录报告》或等效退役文件来确定军人是否符合服役要求。\n这些表格中提供的信息决定了军人是否完成了所有荣誉服役的要求，包括是否荣誉服役，以及如果已退役，其退役是否属于荣誉条件下的退役。\n为了入籍，美国武装部队成员还必须满足成为公民的要求和法定资格。\n具体而言，他或她必须表现出良好的道德品行，并具备足够的英语语言、美国政府和历史知识。\n此外，申请人必须表明对宪法原则的忠诚以及对美国良好秩序和幸福的积极态度。\n然而，符合条件的美国武装部队成员可免除其他入籍要求，包括申请费用以及在美国持续居住和实际居住的要求。\n国防部还拥有扩大军事招募范围至某些非移民及其他合法居留外国人的权力。\n自2008年12月起，“对国家利益至关重要的军事征兵计划”（MAVNI）允许某些美国非移民签证持有者、庇护者、难民及持有临时保护身份的人加入军队，前提是他们具备被认为对军事行动至关重要的医疗、语言及其他技能。\n由于反情报问题，国防部于2016财年结束了MAVNI计划。\n根据国防部数据，在2008年至2016年期间，通过MAVNI计划有10,400人加入了美国军队。\n国土安全部（DHS）负责逮捕、拘留、起诉并驱逐涉嫌及被认定违反美国移民法的外国人。\n移民与海关执法局（ICE）的律师办公室（OPLA）的审理律师在移民法院驱逐程序中代表美国政府担任民事检察官。\n移民与海关执法局的遣返执法部门（ERO）负责逮捕和拘留可能被驱逐的外国人，等待其移民法院案件结果，并根据移民法官的最终驱逐令将其驱逐出境。\n移民与海关执法局的国土安全调查部门（HSI）负责调查涉及非法进出美国及美国境内人员和货物流动的各种国内及国际活动。\n个人可能因多种原因面临被驱逐，包括非法入境美国、逾期停留、被判定犯有某些罪行或参与恐怖活动。\n根据美国移民法，合法永久居民（LPR）属于外国人，因此可能因如管制药物违规或被判定犯有加重重罪等原因而面临移民执法和被驱逐出境。\nHSI探员和ERO官员都可能遇到可能被驱逐的个人，并决定是否向其发出被称为《通知出庭》（NTA）的起诉文件，命令其在移民法官面前出庭回应驱逐指控。\n如果法官认定被告可被驱逐且无其他救济资格，法官将签发驱逐令，在该令行政最终确定后，由ERO执行驱逐。\n退伍军人事务部（VA）负责向美国及海外的退伍军人提供福利和服务，如医疗服务和残疾补偿，包括已被驱逐出美国的退伍军人。\nVA每月向因军队服役导致或加重残疾的退伍军人支付残疾补偿，这被称为“服役相关残疾”。\n患有服役相关残疾的退伍军人也可能有资格获得其他VA福利和服务，例如职业培训。\nVA区域办事处的工作人员负责处理残疾补偿申请。\n退伍军人向VA提交残疾申请后，VA退伍军人服务代表将审核申请，并协助退伍军人收集相关证据，如军队服役记录、体检报告以及VA医疗机构和私人医疗提供者的治疗记录。\n如果需要提供支持以证明申请，VA将安排一项称为“补偿与退休金（C&P）体检”的医学检查，以获取退伍军人残疾及其与军队服役相关的证据。\n在美国，退伍军人健康管理局的医疗提供者通常会进行这些检查。\nVA还与私人公司签订合同进行这些检查。\n在美国以外，退伍军人事务部（VA）与私人公司签订合同，在33个国家进行体检。\n在没有VA承包商进行体检的国家，VA会与大使馆和领事馆的国务院工作人员协调，与私人医疗提供者安排体检。\n一旦VA收到申请证据，评级退伍军人服务代表将评估申请，决定退伍军人是否符合福利资格，如符合，将分配一个百分比评级。\n评级分配后，VA会为协助退伍军人申请的退伍军人服务组织（VSO）工作人员提供最多48小时，以审查申请决定，然后最终确定决定。\n随后，退伍军人服务代表决定奖金额度（如有），并起草决定通知。\n高级退伍军人服务代表随后审查并授权发放奖励给退伍军人。\n有关VA残疾补偿申请流程五个阶段的详细信息，请参见图1。\n根据VA数据，从2013至2018财年，VA收到来自超过390万退伍军人的890多万份残疾补偿申请，并发放了超过202亿美元的福利。\n移民与海关执法局（ICE）已制定政策，规范涉及可能被驱逐退伍军人的案件处理。\n当国土安全调查局（HSI）探员和遣返执法部门（ERO）官员得知他们遇到了一名退伍军人时，这些政策要求他们进行额外的评估，创建额外的文件，并获得管理层批准以继续处理案件。\n具体而言，2004年6月，ICE调查部代理主任发布了一份备忘录，授予各地区办事处国土安全调查局（HSI）特别探员主管（SAC）批准签发涉及现役军人或退伍军人的《通知出庭》（NTA）的权力。\n同样地，2004年9月，ICE拘留与驱逐行动代理主任发布了一份备忘录，授予各地区办事处遣返执法部门（ERO）主任（FOD）批准签发涉及现役军人或退伍军人的《通知出庭》（NTA）的权力。\n为了向退伍军人签发NTA，SAC和FOD必须至少考虑退伍军人的整体犯罪记录、康复证据、与美国的家庭和经济联系、就业历史、健康状况以及社区服务情况。\nSAC和FOD还必须考虑与退伍军人军队服役相关的因素，如服役状态（现役或预备役）、战区任务分配、服役年限以及获得的荣誉勋章。\n为了批准签发NTA，SAC和FOD需完成一份备忘录，将其纳入退伍军人的移民档案中，并在ICE的EARM数据库中更新考虑因素的简要概述。\n此外，2015年11月，ICE主任发布了一项政策，确立了ICE调查其遇到的个人潜在美国公民身份的程序。\n该政策指出，曾经的军队服役是表明个人可能是美国公民的几个指标之一。\n因此，在向退伍军人或具有潜在美国公民身份指标的任何人签发NTA之前，首次遇到该个人的ICE部门（HSI或ERO）应进行事实调查、法律分析，并检查所有可用的国土安全部（DHS）系统，如美国公民和移民服务局（USCIS）的以人为本查询服务，以评估该个人是否为美国公民。\nERO或HSI（进行事实调查的一方）和OPLA的首席法律顾问办公室必须联合准备一份备忘录，评估该个人的公民身份并推荐行动方案，然后将该备忘录提交给ICE总部审查和批准。\n该政策还要求将备忘录的副本存入该个人的移民档案中。\n我们对被驱逐退伍军人的移民档案的分析发现，ICE并未始终遵循这些政策。\n具体而言，ICE政策要求探员和官员记录向退伍军人签发NTA的决定，但未要求在采访可能被驱逐的个人时识别并记录其退伍军人身份。\n我们的分析发现，在2013至2018财年期间，OPLA的复选框显示涉及退伍军人并被列入驱逐程序的87起案件中，有18起（占21%）未满足2004年要求的FOD批准条件，ERO数据显示这些退伍军人已被驱逐。\n我们的分析还发现，在该政策适用的37起案件中，ICE在26起案件（占70%）中未满足2015年政策要求将案件上报总部的规定。\n此外，2018年12月，HSI官员告诉我们，由于在我们审查之前他们并不了解这些政策，因此HSI未遵守2004年或2015年的政策。\nHSI官员表示，在进行行政或刑事调查或决定是否签发NTA时，他们并未区分退伍军人与非退伍军人。\nERO官员表示，移民档案中缺少文件并不一定表明官员未遵守政策；然而，如上所述，政策明确要求ICE在移民档案中添加文件。\n由于ICE未始终遵循这些政策，一些被驱逐的退伍军人可能未获得ICE确定的适用于涉及退伍军人案件的审查和批准水平。\n采取行动确保政策在处理可能被驱逐退伍军人案件中的一致实施，例如发布指导或提供培训，将有助于ICE更好地确保在启动驱逐程序之前，为可能被驱逐的退伍军人提供适当水平的审查和考虑。\nICE尚未制定政策以识别并记录其遇到的所有退伍军人。\n根据遣返执法部门（ERO）官员的说法，当ERO官员遇到一个人时，他们会对该人进行面谈并填写《可驱逐/不可入境外国人记录》（I-213表格），其中记录了该人的国籍和最近的雇主等信息。\n官员表示，ERO官员通常会在面谈过程中得知该人的退伍军人身份。\n然而，ICE并没有一项政策要求探员和官员明确询问并记录退伍军人身份。\n根据ERO官员的说法，ERO不需要这样的政策，因为ERO为新官员提供的《基础移民执法培训计划》已指示官员在面谈可能被驱逐的外国人时询问退伍军人身份。\n《基础移民执法培训计划》包含一个教学计划和一个实践练习，指出《可驱逐/不可入境外国人记录》（I-213表格）应在适用时包括军队服役信息。\n教学计划还包括一份强制性问题清单，ERO官员在每次与外国人接触时都必须提问；然而，该清单中并未包含有关军队服役的任何问题。\n此外，《可驱逐/不可入境外国人记录》（I-213表格）没有专门字段标注退伍军人身份，ERO主管用来审核NTA法律充分性的封面页也未包含有关退伍军人身份的信息。\n对于HSI处理的案件，HSI官员表示，探员通常会通过初步面谈、背景调查或在HSI调查过程中获取的其他信息得知该人的退伍军人身份。\n然而，在我们审查过程中，HSI官员表示，没有政策要求探员询问或记录退伍军人身份，因为如上所述，HSI在处理退伍军人案件时与其他案件并无区别。\n如果没有机制识别和记录退伍军人身份，ICE无法确定其遇到的个人是否可能是退伍军人，也无法判断上述2004年和2015年政策是否适用于相关个案。\n《联邦政府内部控制标准》指出，管理层应设计控制活动，即实施管理指令以实现组织目标的政策、程序、技术和机制。\nICE官员告诉我们，2004年和2015年的政策旨在为ICE探员和官员处理可能被驱逐退伍军人的案件提供指导和方向。\nICE官员认为，这些政策可以更新，向探员和官员提供额外指导，要求在面谈可能被驱逐的个人时询问并记录退伍军人身份。\n如果不制定和实施新政策或修订其2004年和2015年的政策，要求探员和官员询问并记录退伍军人身份，ICE将无法确定其是否已识别出所有遇到的退伍军人，因此无法合理确保其在处理退伍军人案件时始终如一地执行政策和程序。\n由于ICE尚未制定政策以识别并记录其遇到的所有退伍军人，ICE并未维护关于已进入驱逐程序或被驱逐的退伍军人的完整电子数据。\n在ICE探员和官员得知他们遇到退伍军人的情况下，遇到退伍军人的三个ICE部门——ERO、OPLA和HSI——均未维护他们所识别的退伍军人的完整电子数据。\nERO在其数据库EARM中没有用于追踪退伍军人的特定字段。\n根据ERO官员的说法，ERO官员可以在《可驱逐/不可入境外国人记录》（I-213表格）上记录退伍军人身份，但ERO无法通过电子方式搜索这些记录来识别所有遇到的退伍军人。\nERO官员表示，他们不维护退伍军人身份的数据，因为他们并未专门以退伍军人为执法目标。\nOPLA在其数据库PLAnet中有一个复选框用于追踪退伍军人身份，但该字段并非强制性。\nPLAnet还包括一个案件备注部分，OPLA律师可以选择记录退伍军人身份信息。\nOPLA官员表示，退伍军人身份复选框和案件备注的可靠性取决于输入案件信息到PLAnet的律师的勤勉程度。\nHSI官员表示，他们根本不追踪退伍军人身份，因为如上所述，退伍军人身份不会影响他们对案件的处理。\n我们对被驱逐退伍军人移民档案的分析发现，ICE唯一维护的退伍军人身份电子数据——OPLA在PLAnet数据库中的复选框存在局限性。\n具体而言，虽然OPLA的复选框显示我们审查的87名外国人中全都是退伍军人，但根据他们的移民档案中的信息，我们发现87人中有8人（占9%）并未在美国武装部队服役。\n在审查这些案件后，OPLA官员表示，这些人由于人为错误被错误地标记为退伍军人。\nOPLA官员表示，OPLA不要求律师在PLAnet中系统性地追踪退伍军人身份信息，因为该数据库的设计目的不是数据存储库，而是作为OPLA律师的案件管理系统。\nOPLA官员表示，外国人案件的正式记录是纸质移民档案。\n由于ICE未维护其遇到的可能被驱逐退伍军人的完整电子数据，ICE无法确切知道有多少退伍军人已被列入驱逐程序或被驱逐，也无法知道其案件是否按照ICE的政策处理。\n《联邦政府内部控制标准》指出，管理层应使用高质量信息作出明智决策，并评估机构在实现关键目标和应对风险方面的绩效。\n高质量的信息应是适当的、最新的、完整的、准确的、可访问的，并及时提供。\n虽然在纸质移民档案中追踪退伍军人身份可能使ICE能够审查某个特定个人是否是退伍军人，但这并不能提供一种完整且可访问的电子数据，以便该机构系统性地评估其执行政策的表现。\n维护其遇到的退伍军人的完整电子数据将有助于ICE确定其在多大程度上遵守了处理可能被驱逐退伍军人案件的政策。\n例如，ICE可以通过强制字段（如一个用于追踪退伍军人身份的复选框）获取高质量信息。\n根据OPLA的PLAnet数据库中有限的信息，从2013至2018财年，大约有250名退伍军人被列入驱逐程序或被驱逐出美国。\n如上所述，ICE并未维护其遇到的退伍军人的完整电子数据。\n虽然OPLA的PLAnet包括一些被列入驱逐程序的退伍军人的数据，但由于在PLAnet中输入退伍军人身份数据并非强制性要求，因此在我们审查的时间范围内可能还有更多未在PLAnet中记录或未纳入我们分析的退伍军人被列入驱逐程序或被驱逐。\n我们审查了PLAnet中关于2013至2018财年被列入驱逐程序的退伍军人的数据，发现大约有250名退伍军人。\n这包括在PLAnet中标记为退伍军人的个人，但如上所述，并未代表我们审查时间范围内所有可能被列入驱逐程序的退伍军人的完整数据。\n在PLAnet中标记为被列入驱逐程序的约250名退伍军人中，最常见的国籍为墨西哥（约40人）、牙买加（约30人）、萨尔瓦多（约10人）、特立尼达和多巴哥（约10人）、德国（约10人）和危地马拉（约10人）。\n截至2018财年末，约有115人被下令驱逐，约25人被移民法官批准给予驱逐救济或保护，约5人的案件被行政关闭。\n截至2018年11月，其余案件仍在审理中。\n根据ERO数据，从2013至2018财年，ERO已驱逐了约250名退伍军人中的92人，其中90人为有一项或多项刑事定罪的外国国民。\n被驱逐的退伍军人中有9人患有VA认可的服役相关残疾，包括4名患有服役相关创伤后应激障碍的退伍军人。\n根据我们对OPLA复选框标记为退伍军人且ERO标记为已被驱逐的87人的移民档案的审查，我们发现了以下特征：\n26名退伍军人（占30%）荣誉退役；26名（占30%）在荣誉条件下一般退役；13名（占15%）非荣誉退役；8名（占9%）未归类退役；3名（占3%）因不当行为退役；2名（占2%）不名誉退役；8名（占9%）的移民档案中无军队服役记录；1名（占1%）的移民档案中未列出退役性质。\n74名退伍军人（占85%）为合法永久居民（LPR），6名（占7%）为根据《自由联合协定》入伍的马绍尔群岛、密克罗尼西亚联邦和帕劳的公民，6名（占7%）无合法身份证据，1名（占1%）为童年抵美暂缓遣返计划（DACA）的受益者。\n26名退伍军人（占30%）曾向美国公民与移民服务局（USCIS）申请入籍，其中3人提交了多份申请。\n其中17份入籍申请被USCIS拒绝，9份被行政关闭，2份被撤回。\n68名退伍军人（占78%）因至少一项加重重罪定罪而被下令驱逐，剩余19名（占22%）因非加重重罪定罪而被下令驱逐。\n在ICE引用的87名退伍军人《通知出庭》（NTA）中的定罪中：\n32名退伍军人因毒品相关犯罪定罪；20人因性虐待相关犯罪定罪，其中18人涉及未成年人；21人因杀人、袭击或企图杀人或袭击相关犯罪定罪；16人因盗窃相关犯罪定罪；9人因与枪支、爆炸物或爆炸材料相关犯罪定罪。\nUSCIS和国防部（DOD）有政策促进非公民军人和退伍军人入籍，两者均为寻求入籍的非公民军人提供信息资源。\nUSCIS通过一个专门的军事入籍部门为现役及最近退役的美国武装部队成员简化申请和入籍程序，该部门处理军事入籍申请并协助现场官员完成海外的行政入籍任务等。\nUSCIS在特定的美国大使馆、领事馆和军事设施为国外的现役军人进行面试和入籍。\n为向非公民军人和退伍军人提供信息，USCIS设立了一个免费的“军事帮助热线”和一个专门为军人及其家属服务的电子邮箱，并发布了一份《移民基础知识101》介绍供相关利益方使用，包括军事基地的DOD人员。\n此外，USCIS为DOD提供了一份军事入籍申请所需文件清单和入籍申请咨询的沟通指南。\nDOD通过认证军人是否“荣誉服役”，以及其退役是否属于荣誉条件下的退役来决定军人是否满足入籍的服役资格要求。\n此外，根据DOD官员的说法，每个军事设施通常会在其法律服务办公室指定一名入籍顾问。\n该顾问除其他职责外，还协助军人准备入籍申请资料，并充当与USCIS工作人员的中间人。\n例如，在许多陆军设施中，陆军社区服务办公室通常执行此职能。\n尽管USCIS在2013至2018财年期间以相对稳定的比例批准了军事入籍申请，但从2017财年到2018财年收到的申请数量急剧下降，导致2018财年获准入籍的军人人数减少。\n从2013至2018财年，USCIS收到54,617份军事入籍申请；USCIS批准了46,835份（占86%），拒绝了3,410份（占6%）。\n申请人最常见的国籍是菲律宾（6,267人，占11%）、墨西哥（5,760人，占11%）、牙买加（3,510人，占6%）、中国（3,213人，占6%）和大韩民国（2,982人，占5%）。\n尽管2013至2017财年期间军事入籍申请数量相对稳定，但从2017财年到2018财年，申请数量下降了72%，从2017财年的11,812件下降到2018财年的3,291件，如图2所示。\n由于申请数量下降，获准入籍的军人人数也从2017财年的7,303人下降到2018财年的4,309人。\nUSCIS和国防部官员将军事入籍申请数量的下降归因于国防部的几项政策变化。\n首先，国防部于2016年9月暂停了MAVNI计划，减少了非公民参军的人数。\n根据国防部官员的说法，由于反情报问题，国防部在2016财年底暂停了该计划，并决定在2017财年不再续期。\n其次，2017年10月，国防部发布政策，扩大了对合法永久居民（LPR）和MAVNI新兵的背景调查要求。\n政策规定，LPR必须在进入美国武装部队的任何部门之前完成背景调查并获得有利的军事服役适合性认定。\n根据国防部官员的说法，由于背景调查程序的积压，这些新兵的服役被延迟，官员表示，国防部可能需要长达一年时间来完成对某些新兵的增强要求。\n国防部官员表示，他们相信背景调查积压问题将在2019财年底减少，因此，有资格申请入籍的非公民军人人数将会增加。\n第三，2017年10月，国防部延长了非公民在获得入籍所需的荣誉服役认证前必须服役的时间。\n根据新政策，非公民必须完成安全审查、基本军事训练，并服役180天以获得服役性质认定。\n此前，国防部在服役几天后就可以授予这种认定。\nUSCIS根据或配合国防部的政策变化，对其军事入籍程序进行了多项调整。\n首先，2017年7月，USCIS确定完成国防部背景调查与MAVNI新兵的入籍资格相关。\n因此，USCIS开始要求目前服役的MAVNI新兵在USCIS对其进行面试、批准其申请或为其宣誓入籍之前，完成所有所需的国防部背景调查。\n其次，2018年1月，USCIS结束了在基本训练地点为新兵入籍的计划。\n该计划被称为“基本训练入籍计划”，始于2009年8月，旨在为陆军的五个基本训练地点的新兵提供服务，并为非公民新兵在完成基本训练之前提供入籍机会。\n由于国防部2017年10月的政策变化延长了非公民在获得服役性质认定之前的服役时间，非公民军人在完成基本训练时已不再符合入籍要求。\n因此，USCIS关闭了位于西尔堡、班宁堡和杰克逊堡的入籍办公室。\n根据USCIS数据，USCIS处理军事入籍的时间也从2017财年的平均5.4个月增加到2018财年的12.5个月。\nUSCIS官员将这一增加归因于MAVNI新兵的国防部背景调查积压，以及来自非军事申请者的入籍申请数量增加。\n根据退伍军人事务部（VA）官员的说法，公民身份，包括移民执法或驱逐历史，并不影响退伍军人获得VA福利和服务的资格。\n因此，被ICE驱逐的退伍军人有权享受与其他居住在国外的退伍军人相同的VA福利和服务。\n尽管因违反移民法而被驱逐本身并不会影响获得VA福利和服务的资格，但居住在国外会影响某些福利和服务的资格，如表1所示。\n这些差异适用于所有居住在国外的退伍军人，包括被ICE驱逐的退伍军人和选择居住在国外的退伍军人。\n被驱逐的退伍军人在获得某些他们本来有资格享受的福利时可能面临额外的障碍，因为他们可能被禁止前往美国。\n例如，被驱逐的退伍军人可能无法出席VA残疾等级决定的上诉听证会，因为VA仅在美国境内举行此类听证会。\n此外，被驱逐的退伍军人如果无法前往美国进行医疗转诊和案件管理，可能无法获得某些职业康复和就业服务。\n居住在国外的退伍军人（包括被驱逐的退伍军人）可能在获取某些福利和服务时遇到挑战，包括残疾申请处理较慢、外国医疗计划（FMP）赔偿申请报销、C&P体检安排及质量相关问题，以及与VA的沟通困难。\n根据VA官员的说法，自2013财年以来，VA处理居住在国外退伍军人（外国申请）残疾补偿申请的时间有所改善。\n例如，在2013财年，VA处理外国申请的平均时间为521天，而在2018财年，VA处理外国申请的时间减少到平均131天。\n然而，截至2018年9月，VA未达到其处理外国申请125天的及时性目标，并且VA处理外国申请的时间比国内申请平均多花了29天。\nVA官员将外国申请处理时间较长归因于不可靠的外国邮政系统、获取和翻译外国记录的问题等。\n根据VA数据，从2013至2018财年，VA收到来自26,858名居住在国外退伍军人的残疾补偿申请，并发放了超过8,500万美元的福利。\n根据VA官员的说法，通过FMP向退伍军人或其医疗提供者报销服役相关疾病治疗费用的医疗申请处理时间也有所改善。\n例如，2018年10月，FMP在40天内处理了53.8%的申请，而到2019年3月，FMP在40天内处理了70%的申请。\n然而，截至2019年3月，VA未能达到通过FMP在40天内处理90%申请报销的及时性目标。\nFMP官员将这些延误归因于2017年4月失去4个员工岗位，以及2017年10月FMP接管来自菲律宾的申请。\n为了改善FMP的处理及时性，FMP官员表示，VA为2019财年资助了3个新的全职等效职位。\n从2013至2018财年，VA报告收到来自居住在国外的退伍军人和医疗提供者的373,916份申请报销，并发放了超过1.69亿美元的报销金额。\n根据VA和退伍军人服务组织（VSO）官员的说法，居住在国外的退伍军人（包括被驱逐的退伍军人）在C&P体检的安排及质量方面面临挑战。\n如前所述，居住在国外的退伍军人并未从VA医疗提供者处接受C&P体检，而可能由VA承包商或在VA无承包商的国家由美国大使馆或领事馆安排的私人提供者进行体检。\n根据VA数据，从2013至2018财年，VA通过承包商在国外完成了超过27,000次体检，并通过美国大使馆和领事馆完成了6,800次体检。", "reference_summary": "Throughout U.S. history, noncitizens have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Although the Immigration and Nationality Act allows noncitizen service members to acquire citizenship, some veterans may not apply or may not satisfy all eligibility criteria. If the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that a noncitizen veteran is potentially removable, the veteran may be subject to administrative immigration enforcement and removal. ICE, among other things, is responsible for identifying and removing aliens who violate U.S. immigration law. GAO was asked to review issues related to the removal of noncitizen veterans. This report examines (1) the extent to which ICE has developed and implemented policies for handling and tracking cases of potentially removable veterans; (2) how federal agencies facilitate the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and what is known about the number who have applied for naturalization; and (3) how removal affects veterans' eligibility for and access to VA benefits and services. GAO reviewed documentation, met with agency officials, analyzed available data on veterans placed in removal proceedings, and conducted a review of removed veterans' alien files. GAO also analyzed data on military naturalization applications. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has developed policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans who may be subject to removal from the United States, but does not consistently adhere to those policies, and does not consistently identify and track such veterans. When ICE agents and officers learn they have encountered a potentially removable veteran, ICE policies require them to take additional steps to proceed with the case. GAO found that ICE did not consistently follow its policies involving veterans who were placed in removal proceedings from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. Consistent implementation of its policies would help ICE better ensure that veterans receive appropriate levels of review before they are placed in removal proceedings. Additionally, ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters during interviews, and in cases when agents and officers do learn they have encountered a veteran, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data. Therefore, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies for handling veterans' cases. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have policies facilitating the naturalization of noncitizen service members and veterans, and provide informational resources to noncitizen service members seeking naturalization. The number of military naturalization applications received by USCIS declined sharply from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, resulting in a decreased number of applications approved in fiscal year 2018. USCIS and DOD officials attributed this decline to several DOD policy changes that reduced the number of noncitizens joining the military . Citizenship status, including removal history, does not affect a veteran's eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and services. However, living abroad affects eligibility for certain VA benefits and services. Veterans living abroad may also experience challenges accessing certain benefits and services, such as slower disability claim processing. GAO recommends that ICE (1) ensure consistent implementation of its existing policies for handling veterans' cases; (2) develop a policy or revise its current policies to identify and document veterans; and (3) collect and maintain complete data on veterans in removal proceedings or who have been removed.

"总体而言，在我们审查的15,453项SBIR和STTR奖励中，各组成机构在2016年至2018财年期间在规定时间内完成了12,890项（占84%）的提案审查并通知获奖者。\n《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人其决定，并要求NIH和NSF在一年内完成此项通知。\n在15,453项奖励中，有2,533项（占16%）是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。\n在我们审查的数据中，28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求，另有9个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了要求。\n其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。\n表2列出了各组成机构的平均和中位通知时间以及在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例。\n有些通知是在规定时间之后的几天内发出的，而有些则晚了几个月。\n例如，教育部在2016年至2018财年中，所有超过90天的通知均在第91天发出。\n该部门官员将这一天的差异归因于将90天的要求解释为3个月的要求。\n同样，所有超过90天要求的陆军STTR奖励通知均在第92天发出。\n在超过规定时间的2,533项奖励中，通知平均晚约1个半月发出。\n在我们审查的3个财年中，一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化，而其他组成机构则保持了相对一致的比例。\n例如，能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例低于50%，远低于我们审查的其他财年。\n表3描述了我们审查的3个财年中，各组成机构在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例。\n机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知获奖者所需时间的几个因素，包括：(1) 审查人员的可用性，(2) 待审查提案的数量，以及(3) 其他机构特定因素。\n审查人员的可用性。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，机构工作人员或外部审查人员的可用性影响了他们审查提案所需的时间。\n例如，美国农业部官员告诉我们，该机构无法在90天内通知获奖者，因为他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持其外部同行评审系统。\n农业部官员将其审查过程与NSF和NIH的过程进行比较，这两个机构被要求在一年内完成提案审查和通知。\n同样，海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成其提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。\n这些审查人员是海军员工，他们在继续履行常规职责的同时，抽出部分时间审查SBIR和STTR提案。\n据海军官员称，尽管他们根据提案数量为审查人员设定了最后期限，但常规职责或更高优先级任务的冲突可能导致审查人员错过最后期限。\n相比之下，教育部官员表示，他们在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员，以便尽快开始审查工作。\n然而，其他机构可能在审查收到的提案之前无法确定审查人员需要哪些领域的专业知识。\n提案数量。\n我们采访的一些组成机构官员表示，他们收到的提案数量影响了审查提案和通知获奖者所需的时间。\n例如，交通部官员表示，他们收到的提案数量从两项到四十项不等，这使得难以预测负责提案审查的机构评估人员的工作量。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所的官员表示，他们收到的提案数量每年都在波动。\n由于机构必须审查所有符合最低要求的提案，提案数量的增加直接增加了提案审查人员的工作量。\n其他机构特定因素。\n一些组成机构官员指出，与其机构或流程相关的特定因素也会影响所需时间。\n例如，卫生与公共服务部下属的两个组成机构——疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）和食品药品管理局（FDA）在2016至2018财年中未能在规定时间内通知任何获奖者。\nCDC和FDA参与了由NIH主导的提案征集和审查过程。\n然而，尽管NIH有一年的时间通知获奖者，这些机构被要求在90个日历日内完成通知。\nCDC官员表示，参与时间较长的NIH计划比创建自己的审查过程更高效，并且可以利用NIH的额外项目来支持小型企业获奖者。\n环境保护局官员告诉我们，他们的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，这使得该机构经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的通知要求。\n这些审查包括对提案响应性的行政审查、外部同行评审过程以及SBIR项目办公室的内部审查。\n一些机构官员还指出，持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。\n在这些情况下，由于机构活动的资金可用性或金额不确定，提案审查和通知活动可能会受到影响。\n例如，一名国防微电子活动官员告诉我们，他们的机构通常会在90天内完成提案审查过程，但在确定本财年后期的奖励资金可用性之前不会通知获奖者。\n国家标准与技术研究所的官员描述了由于在奖励前评估中发现最初的获奖者不符合资格而导致通知替代获奖者的延迟。\n该机构立即进行了替代选择，但该替代获奖者是在超过90天要求约20天后才收到通知。\n总体而言，在我们审查的15,453项奖励中，各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有11,710项（占76%）在推荐时间内发出。\nSBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励，并建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成。\n在15,453项奖励中，有3,743项（占24%）是在推荐时间之后发出的。\n在我们审查的数据中，28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励，另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了这一要求。\n其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。\n对于超过推荐时间发出的3,743项奖励，平均延迟约两个月半。\n表4列出了各组成机构的平均和中位奖励发放时间以及在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例。\n在我们审查的3个财年中，一些组成机构每年在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例发生了显著变化，而其他组成机构在这一比例上则保持了相对一致。\n例如，能源部高级研究计划署-能源在我们审查的三年中没有在推荐时间内发出任何奖励。\n表5描述了我们审查的3个财年中，各组成机构在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例。\n机构官员描述了增加奖励发放时间的几个因素，包括：(1) 某些类型合同需要额外时间，(2) 资助和合同官员的可用性，(3) 机构官员之间的协调延误，(4) 获奖者的响应性，以及(5) 奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "本报告审查了2016至2018财年期间，15,453项SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查和通知时间，以及奖励发放时间。大多数机构在90天内通知了84%的获奖者，但有16%的奖励通知超过了规定时间，平均延迟约1个半月。在奖励发放方面，28个组成机构中有76%在推荐时间内发放了奖励，但24%的奖励超过了推荐时间，平均延迟约2.5个月。多个因素影响了这些时间，包括审查人员的可用性、提案数量、机构特定因素、合同类型、合同官员的可用性、机构间的协调延迟、获奖者的响应性以及奖励资金的可用性。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [0, 0, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.5, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.3333333333333333, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.75}

其他机构特定因素。\n审查人员的可用性。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，机构工作人员或外部审查人员的可用性影响了他们审查提案所需的时间。\n例如，美国农业部官员告诉我们，该机构无法在90天内通知获奖者，因为他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持其外部同行评审系统。\n农业部官员将其审查过程与NSF和NIH的过程进行比较，这两个机构被要求在一年内完成提案审查和通知。\n同样，海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成其提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。\n这些审查人员是海军员工，他们在继续履行常规职责的同时，抽出部分时间审查SBIR和STTR提案。\n据海军官员称，尽管他们根据提案数量为审查人员设定了最后期限，但常规职责或更高优先级任务的冲突可能导致审查人员错过最后期限。\n相比之下，教育部官员表示，他们在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员，以便尽快开始审查工作。\n然而，其他机构可能在审查收到的提案之前无法确定审查人员需要哪些领域的专业知识。\n提案数量。\n我们采访的一些组成机构官员表示，他们收到的提案数量影响了审查提案和通知获奖者所需的时间。\n例如，交通部官员表示，他们收到的提案数量从两项到四十项不等，这使得难以预测负责提案审查的机构评估人员的工作量。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所的官员表示，他们收到的提案数量每年都在波动。\n由于机构必须审查所有符合最低要求的提案，提案数量的增加直接增加了提案审查人员的工作量。\n其他机构特定因素。\n一些组成机构官员指出，与其机构或流程相关的特定因素也会影响所需时间。\n例如，卫生与公共服务部下属的两个组成机构——疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）和食品药品管理局（FDA）在2016至2018财年中未能在规定时间内通知任何获奖者。\nCDC和FDA参与了由NIH主导的提案征集和审查过程。\n然而，尽管NIH有一年的时间通知获奖者，这些机构被要求在90个日历日内完成通知。\nCDC官员表示，参与时间较长的NIH计划比创建自己的审查过程更高效，并且可以利用NIH的额外项目来支持小型企业获奖者。\n环境保护局官员告诉我们，他们的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，这使得该机构经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的通知要求。\n这些审查包括对提案响应性的行政审查、外部同行评审过程以及SBIR项目办公室的内部审查。\n一些机构官员还指出，持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。\n在这些情况下，由于机构活动的资金可用性或金额不确定，提案审查和通知活动可能会受到影响。\n例如，一名国防微电子活动官员告诉我们，他们的机构通常会在90天内完成提案审查过程，但在确定本财年后期的奖励资金可用性之前不会通知获奖者。\n国家标准与技术研究所的官员描述了由于在奖励前评估中发现最初的获奖者不符合资格而导致通知替代获奖者的延迟。\n该机构立即进行了替代选择，但该替代获奖者是在超过90天要求约20天后才收到通知。\n总体而言，在我们审查的15,453项奖励中，各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有11,710项（占76%）在推荐时间内发出。\nSBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励，并建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成。\n在15,453项奖励中，有3,743项（占24%）是在推荐时间之后发出的。\n在我们审查的数据中，28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励，另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了这一要求。\n其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。\n对于超过推荐时间发出的3,743项奖励，平均延迟约两个月半。\n表4列出了各组成机构的平均和中位奖励发放时间以及在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例。\n在我们审查的3个财年中，一些组成机构每年在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例发生了显著变化，而其他组成机构在这一比例上则保持了相对一致。\n例如，能源部高级研究计划署-能源在我们审查的三年中没有在推荐时间内发出任何奖励。\n表5描述了我们审查的3个财年中，各组成机构在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例。\n机构官员描述了增加奖励发放时间的几个因素，包括：(1) 某些类型合同需要额外时间，(2) 资助和合同官员的可用性，(3) 机构官员之间的协调延误，(4) 获奖者的响应性，以及(5) 奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "这份报告分析了2016-2018财年期间美国联邦政府SBIR和STTR小企业创新研究计划的执行情况。主要发现包括：1) 在15,453项奖励中，84%的提案审查在规定时间内完成，16%超时；2) 76%的奖励在推荐时间内发放，24%延迟；3) 影响提案审查时间的主要因素包括审查人员可用性、提案数量和机构特定因素；4) 影响奖励发放时间的因素包括合同类型(成本补偿合同比固定价格合同耗时更长)、资助官员可用性、机构间协调、获奖者响应速度以及资金可用性；5) 一些机构(如空军)通过流程改进提高了效率。报告建议未来可能需要分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的执行情况，并关注两个阶段之间的衔接时间对小企业的影响。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "ka_keyfact_label": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.48484848484848486, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.8571428571428571}

奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "编者按:本文不代表BBC立场和观点。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [0], "fv_error_type": ["out-of-article error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.0, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.0, "ka_sentence_label": [0], "ka_conciseness": 0.0}

奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "这份文本是一篇关于美国小企业创新研究（SBIR）和小企业技术转移（STTR）计划发放奖励的审计报告。报告回顾了2016至2018财年期间28个联邦机构向小型企业发放的15,453项奖励。报告发现，在规定90天内通知获奖者方面，机构的表现不一，其中84%的奖励符合要求。在规定日期后通知获奖者的主要原因包括审查人员的可用性、待审查提案的数量以及机构特定的因素。报告还发现，在推荐时间内发放奖励的比例为76%，在推荐时间后发放奖励的主要原因包括合同类型、资助和合同官员的可用性、机构官员之间的协调延误、获奖者的响应性和奖励资金的可用性。报告还详细介绍了每个机构的奖励发放情况，并提供了相关机构的评论和回复。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "ka_keyfact_label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.30303030303030304, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "ka_conciseness": 0.5}

奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "根据美国政府审计署(GAO)对2016至2018财年小企业创新研究(SBIR)和小企业技术转让(STTR)计划数据的审查，参与机构在规定时间内完成提案审查和发放奖励的及时性有所不同。28个机构中有3个在所有奖励中满足通知要求，9个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到这一要求。机构官员指出，审查人员的可用性、提案数量和其他机构特定因素影响了提案审查和通知获奖者的时间。成本补偿合同的发放时间通常比固定价格合同长。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [1, 1, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 1.0, "ka_keyfact_label": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ka_completeness": 0.21212121212121213, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.75}

奖励资金的可用性。\n成本补偿合同。\n我们采访的一些组成机构的官员表示，合同类型是影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放时间的一个因素。\n具体而言，官员们表示，由于需要根据联邦采购法规审查获奖者的会计系统，成本补偿合同的发放时间更长。\n例如，国防高级研究计划署（DARPA）的官员表示，由于会计系统审查，成本补偿合同的奖励时间通常比固定价格合同更长。\n根据DARPA官员的说法，这一审查可能会为奖励流程增加45天或更长时间。\n2019年2月，我们发现国防部没有一个机制来监控和确保承包商业务系统的审查和审计及时进行，并建议该部门开发此类机制。\n我们对SBIR和STTR奖励数据的分析证实，组成机构在发放成本补偿合同的奖励上花费的时间比发放固定价格合同更多。\n我们发现，在2016至2018财年的数据中，被确定为成本补偿合同的SBIR和STTR奖励的发放时间显著长于被确定为固定价格合同的奖励，如图1所示。\n固定价格合同平均需要152天，而成本补偿合同平均需要231天（多出79天）。\n成本补偿合同的发放时间也比未明确为固定价格或成本补偿的合同平均多出40天。\n资助或合同官员的可用性。\n根据一些组成机构官员的说法，机构工作人员在协商合同或资助方面的可用性或经验可能是一个因素。\n首先，一些官员表示，资助或合同官员的有限可用性是影响奖励发放时间的一个因素，可能会导致延误。\n例如，两处陆军项目办公室的官员表示，合同官员的工作负担很重，而SBIR和STTR奖励是较大合同积压的一部分。\n同样，国家标准与技术研究所和国家海洋与大气管理局的官员也表示，资助和合同官员的可用性是联邦机构面临的普遍问题，可能影响奖励的及时性。\n其次，一些组成机构的官员表示，合同官员在处理小型企业奖励方面的经验水平会影响SBIR和STTR奖励发放所需的时间。\n机构官员之间的协调。\n空军官员表示，机构官员之间的协调需求，例如合同官员与提案评估员之间的协调，可能会导致延误。\n由于提案审查和奖励过程可能需要多个官员之间的协调，而这些官员并不总是立即可用，因此在一个官员等待另一个官员提供意见或信息时可能会发生延误。\n从2018财年开始，空军对其部分奖励的提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整，包括为审查人员、合同官员和其他机构官员安排专门时间共同评估提案并处理奖励。\n这一变化保证了机构官员的可用性，并减少了这些官员之间协调所需的时间。\n总体而言，这使得该机构能够在几天或几周内发放奖励。\n据机构官员称，空军在2018年通过此过程发放了约150项奖励，并预计2019财年约三分之一的空军奖励以及2020财年一半的奖励将采用这一加速流程。\n获奖者的响应性。\n一些组成机构的官员表示，小型企业的响应性是延误的一个因素。\n例如，美国农业部官员表示，该部门的大多数SBIR资助获得者是首次获得资助的企业，从未与联邦政府合作过，这可能会延长发放奖励所需的时间。\n为了获得SBIR或STTR奖励，小型企业必须提交一份证明其符合规模、所有权和其他要求的认证。\n因此，延迟提供这些认证或奖励机构要求的其他信息可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n在我们2018年7月的报告中，审查了2014至2016财年DOD的武器系统相关合同，合同官员指出，更快地响应额外信息请求的承包商可以帮助减少从发布招标到授予合同之间的时间。\n资金的可用性。\n一些组成机构官员表示，由于持续性决议或部门间资金转移的延迟，确定小型企业奖励的资金可用金额的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。\n例如，NASA官员表示，他们会在财年开始时估算该机构的研发预算，以计算SBIR和STTR奖励所需的金额。\n据这些官员称，如果NASA在财年初根据持续性决议运营，则估算金额可能会小于最终拨款金额。\n在这种情况下，NASA将重新审查其提案，从最初估算中被拒绝的提案中授予额外奖励，这将导致某些奖励的发放时间更长。\n我们向SBA及11个在2016至2018财年参与SBIR和STTR计划的机构提供了本报告草案，以供其审查和评论。\nSBA、国防部和教育部提供了书面评论，已在附录II、III和IV中重现。\n此外，能源部、卫生与公共服务部下属的NIH、交通部以及商务部下属的国家标准与技术研究所提供了技术评论，我们根据需要进行了采纳。\n其余机构表示没有评论。\n教育部在其正式评论中表示，已采取措施确保未来的获奖者将在规定时间内收到通知。\nSBA和国防部在评论中建议，在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n在本报告中，我们合并了第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励，因为在我们审查的2016至2018财年的数据中，未发现第一阶段和第二阶段奖励在通知时间上的统计显著差异。\n然而，一些分析表明，第二阶段的奖励发放时间更长。\n我们可能会在后续报告中进一步研究第一阶段和第二阶段奖励的差异。\nSBA还描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。\n在本报告中，我们没有评估第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间的时间，但同意这一时间可能在未来的报告中引起关注，因为正如SBA所指出的，奖励之间的时间可能会影响小型企业保留关键人员的能力。\nSBA还要求对我们分析中使用的各种日期和数据进行解释，我们更新了报告，加入了收集奖励数据时使用的定义，并更详细地描述了我们的数据。\n国防部还表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其90天和180天的时效要求中。\n然而，我们向发布该指令的机构SBA确认，选择通知的90天要求和奖励发放的180天建议适用于第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。\n国防部进一步表示，后续的第二阶段奖励可能在初始第二阶段奖励结束后的几年后发放，不应包括在第二阶段奖励的分析中。\n在本报告中，我们采取措施从数据中排除了这些异常值。\n我们将把本报告的副本发送给相关的国会委员会、SBA的代理管理员以及其他相关方。\n此外，该报告可在GAO网站http://www.gao.gov上免费获取。\n如果您或您的工作人员对本报告有任何疑问，请通过(202)

programs began in 1982 and 1992, respectively, federal agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling around $46 billion to help small businesses develop and commercialize new technologies. Eleven agencies participate in the SBIR program and five of them also participate in the STTR program. Each agency issues a solicitation requesting proposals at least once a year. Agencies then review proposal submissions and issue awards using grants or contracts. The SBIR and STTR policy directive recommends that most agencies issue awards no more than 180 calendar days from solicitation close. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of agencies' SBIR and STTR proposal review and award issuance. This report examines the time agencies spend issuing SBIR and STTR awards and the factors that affect the time spent, among other things. Within the 11 agencies, GAO reviewed 28 component agencies that participate in these programs. GAO analyzed agency-provided award data from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 for 15,453 awards and interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration and 26 of the component agencies. In fiscal years 2016 through 2018, agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards we reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period. However, component agencies varied in the percentage of awards that they issued within the recommended time (see figure). Agency officials described a number of factors that can affect award issuance timelines, including: Some agencies use cost reimbursement contracts, which require additional agency review under federal acquisition regulations. Some contracting officers have limited expertise in issuing SBIR and STTR awards and their overall workloads can be heavy. Small businesses may be slow to respond to agency requests for information, such as requests for information needed to meet government contracting requirements.", "summary": "这份政府问责局（GAO）报告审查了2016财年至2018财年小型企业创新研究（SBIR）和小企业技术转移（STTR）奖励的及时性。报告发现，虽然大多数机构在规定的时限内通知了奖励获得者，但在发放奖励方面存在显著延误。通知时间：各机构在规定的时限内完成了84%的提案审查和获奖者通知。3个机构达到了100%的合规性，9个机构达到了至少90%的合规性。导致延误的因素包括审查员的可用性、待审查提案的数量以及机构特有的因素，例如对农业部的外部同行评审系统的依赖，以及疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）和食品和药物管理局（FDA）参与的由国家卫生研究院（NIH）主导的较长提案征集流程。奖励发放时间：各机构仅在规定的时限内发放了76%的奖励。3个机构发放了100%的奖励，5个机构至少发放了90%的奖励。导致奖励发放延误的因素包括成本补偿合同的额外时间、资助和合同官员的可用性、机构官员之间的协调延误、获奖者的响应性以及奖励资金的可用性。成本补偿合同平均比固定价格合同多花费79天的时间。该报告包括来自多个机构的反馈，包括小型企业管理局（SBA）和国防部，它们建议在未来的报告中分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。GAO解释说，在本报告中合并了这两个阶段，因为在通知时间上没有发现统计学上的显著差异，但承认第二阶段的奖励发放时间可能更长，这值得在未来进行研究。SBA还强调了尽量减少第一阶段和后续第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性，以及小型企业保留关键人员的能力。国防部澄清说，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其及时性要求，但SBA确认这些要求适用于这两个阶段。", "keyfacts": ["各组成机构在2016至2018财年间，在规定时间内完成了84%的SBIR和STTR奖励的提案审查并通知获奖者。", "16%的奖励是在规定时间之后通知获奖者的。", "28个组成机构中有3个机构在所有奖励中均满足通知要求。", "另有9个组成机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了通知要求。", "其余16个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了通知要求。", "《小企业法》和SBIR/STTR政策指令要求大多数机构在90个日历日内通知申请人。", "NIH和NSF被要求在一年内通知申请人。", "一些组成机构每年在规定时间内通知获奖者的比例发生了较大变化。", "能源部科学办公室和陆军SBIR计划在某一财年中，通知获奖者的比例低于50%。", "机构官员描述了影响提案审查和通知时间的因素，包括审查人员的可用性和提案数量。", "美国农业部官员表示，他们需要额外时间来识别和招聘专家以支持外部同行评审。", "海军官员表示，审查人员的可用性是完成提案审查和通知过程的最大变量。", "教育部在收到提案之前识别并培训审查人员。", "提案数量影响了审查和通知获奖者所需的时间。", "环境保护局的审查过程包括三个连续的审查，导致经常需要申请豁免以超过90天的要求。", "持续性决议、预算封存或政府关门可能会减缓提案审查进程。", "国防微电子活动在90天内完成提案审查，但通知延迟到确定资金可用性之后。", "各组成机构在2016至2018财年间有76%的奖励在推荐时间内发出。", "SBIR/STTR政策指令建议大多数机构在180天内发出奖励。", "建议NIH和NSF在15个月内完成奖励发放。", "28个组成机构中有3个在推荐时间内发出了所有奖励。", "另有5个机构在至少90%的奖励中达到了推荐时间的要求。", "其余20个组成机构在不到90%的奖励中满足了推荐时间的要求。", "成本补偿合同的发放时间比固定价格合同更长。", "DARPA官员表示，成本补偿合同通常需要更多时间来授予。", "资助或合同官员的可用性影响了奖励发放的时间。", "机构官员之间的协调可能导致奖励过程的延误。", "空军对其提案审查和奖励过程进行了调整以减少协调延误。", "小型企业的响应性可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "确定资金可用性的延迟可能会延迟奖励的发放。", "SBA和国防部建议在未来的报告中应分别评估第一阶段和第二阶段的奖励。", "SBA描述了尽量减少第一阶段和第二阶段奖励之间延迟的重要性。", "国防部表示，SBIR和STTR政策指令并未明确将第二阶段奖励纳入其时效要求中。"], "keyfacts_category": ["Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Regulation and Policy", "Regulation and Policy", "Governance", "Governance", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Governance", "Evaluations", "Evaluations", "Recommendations", "Recommendations", "Regulation and Policy"], "fv_label": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "fv_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"], "fv_faithfulness": 0.6153846153846154, "ka_keyfact_label": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "ka_completeness": 0.3939393939393939, "ka_sentence_label": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "ka_conciseness": 0.7692307692307693}

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",

"播音员：在世界各地的教室里都能看到，这是CNN新闻室。\n谢莉·沃尔科特，联合主持人：周一快乐，欢迎来到CNN新闻室。我是谢莉·沃尔科特。今天有很多内容。以下是即将到来的内容。\n布什总统在上任的第一周就开始积极行动。我们将看看他计划做些什么。\n然后，在“环境专栏”中，亚特兰大附近的新房子可能会为房主节省大量金钱。\n从美国的郊区到俄罗斯的荒野，“世界观”聚焦于狼。\n在“编年史”中，一支高中乐队在一次高调的表演中亮相。\n美国总统权力交接，带来了一个周末的开始和结束，派对和抗议。\n乔治·W·布什总统于周六宣誓就任美国第43任总统。这个周末的权力交接虽然有争议但顺利。\n前总统克林顿告别了他担任了八年的职位，将他的行政职责交给了他的继任者，乔治·W·布什总统。\n在他14分钟的就职演说中，布什总统承诺团结美国，并以文明和同情心领导。\n乔治·W·布什，美国总统：我将以这些原则生活和领导：以文明推进我的信念，以勇气追求公共利益，为更大的正义和同情心发声，呼吁责任并努力践行。\n沃尔科特：就职典礼后举行了三小时的游行，随后是一系列的就职舞会。\n虽然成千上万的美国人在布什先生的大日子里欢呼，但还有成千上万的人激烈抗议，创造了一位总统历史学家所称的自1969年理查德·尼克松上任以来最大的就职抗议。\n即将到来的一周对布什先生来说将是忙碌的，因为他开始处理教育、经济和减税问题。\n在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统为他的大规模减税计划获得了更多支持。\n布什先生提议进行为期10年、1.3万亿美元的减税计划。帕蒂·戴维斯现在有更多关于减税计划和同意支持它的民主党参议员的报道。\n帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN记者（画外音）：在他上任的第一个完整工作日，乔治·W·布什总统和他1.3万亿美元的减税计划获得了重大推动。\n乔治亚州民主党参议员泽尔·米勒计划与共和党参议院银行委员会主席菲尔·格拉姆共同发起布什的减税计划。\n安德鲁·卡德，白宫幕僚长：如果格拉姆参议员找到了一个民主党共同发起人，我感到非常高兴。我们预计很多民主党人会支持我们的计划，因为这是对美国有利的事情。\n戴维斯：米勒的发言人说，引用，“他在竞选中强调他想要成为一个两党合作的人，他想要成为一个减税的参议员，就像他作为一个减税的州长一样，这对他来说是一个很好的机会。”\n米勒是一位南方温和派，是第一个表示他会投票支持约翰·阿什克罗夫特的人，布什总统有争议的司法部长提名人。\n在布什先生的首要任务之一上的两党合作可能有助于新总统在国会山推动他的立法议程。\n斯图尔特·罗森伯格，罗森伯格政治报告：乔治·W·布什非常重视与对方接触，这是第一次成功。现在有一个民主党人加入了减税提案，这表明布什有其他机会，并表明布什对民主党人有一定的吸引力。\n戴维斯：但布什的减税计划还有很长的路要走。民主党人说这将超出预算盈余。\n参议员汤姆·达施勒（D-SD），少数党领袖：无论是分成几部分还是全部提出，我认为关键问题是整个方案的成本。我们无法承担1.6万亿美元的减税，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n戴维斯（镜头前）：新总统将不得不争取民主党人的支持。他可能无法在分裂的国会中通过他的整个计划。不过，现在他离目标又近了一步。帕蒂·戴维斯，CNN，国会山。\n沃尔科特：寒冷的天气和飙升的能源成本。对于许多美国人来说，这个冬天是一个昂贵的组合。取暖费每月可能飙升到数百美元，并不是每个人都能负担得起让家里保持温暖。\n现在，乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一些房屋建筑商正在建造房屋以应对这些因素，这些房屋将在夏季帮助抵挡热量，并在冬季保持冷空气。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔报道这一倡议。\n布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN记者（画外音）：他们正在亚特兰大附近建造五座所谓的“地球工艺”房屋；这些房屋是环保的，保证每月为房主节省高达100美元或更多的能源成本。\n当然，大多数房屋都配备了节能电器，如洗衣机、烘干机、洗碗机和空调设备。\n但建筑商说，至少同样重要的是房屋的建造方式，采用重型绝缘材料、密封管道泄漏的密封胶、密封灯具、门周围的橡胶密封。\n吉姆·哈克勒，地球工艺房屋计划：通常在大多数房屋上，即使是新房屋，三分之一的供暖和制冷成本因泄漏而损失。\n卡贝尔：这些房屋的另一个重要组成部分是防止泄漏：双层玻璃窗，带有特殊玻璃，可以反射部分阳光。\n所有这些都增加了房屋的成本，最多可能增加2％，但设计师说，从长远来看，这是非常值得的。\n汤姆·法利克，房屋建筑商：因此，1到1.5％的总成本很容易通过房主在头几年节省的能源费用来摊销。\n卡贝尔：购房者是否准备好购买更节能且略贵的房屋？显然有些人是。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们确实买了一座太阳能房屋并支付了额外费用，并且非常享受。\n未透露姓名的女性：一开始就全部完成。如果你试图后来添加，它将比一开始做要贵得多。\n卡贝尔：这就是房屋建筑商所依赖的态度。数字是巨大的，亚特兰大正在建造700座地球工艺房屋，全国各地正在建造数千座类似的绿色房屋。布莱恩·卡贝尔，CNN，亚特兰大。\n沃尔科特：在今天的“世界观”中，我们关注环境、商业和政治。我们的世界之旅带我们到俄罗斯，聚焦宗教和犹太复兴。\n更多来自该地区的报道，我们关注野生动物和狼的呼唤。我们还前往牙买加，了解一些历史和文化。\n但首先我们关注伊拉克和科威特。十年前，美国总统乔治·布什领导了一次盟军攻击，以解放科威特免受伊拉克入侵。\n现在，前美国总统的儿子成为总司令，我们的简·阿拉夫看看老对手的看法。\n简·阿拉夫，CNN记者（画外音）：在一个理解王朝的地区，乔治·W·布什追随他父亲的脚步进入白宫并不令人惊讶。\n但在伊拉克，布什这个名字与战争同义。这个女人努力回忆她在1991年做了什么，直到邻居提醒她：“布什战争。”\n在海湾国家，这些国家曾为解放科威特而参战，当时的总统乔治·布什是英雄。在伊拉克，他是一个恶棍，这一遗产在巴格达政府拥有的拉希德酒店中被字面上刻在石头上。\n1993年，在据称伊拉克企图暗杀前美国总统后，酒店遭到美国巡航导弹的袭击。\n（镜头前）：伊拉克否认该阴谋，但表示美国多年来一直试图摆脱萨达姆·侯赛因总统。\n（画外音）：美国内阁中一个熟悉的面孔，海湾战争将军科林·鲍威尔，再次谈论与伊拉克的未竟事业。\n塔里克·阿齐兹，伊拉克副总理：他与伊拉克有什么业务？你看？如果他想继续前政府对伊拉克采取的侵略政策，那是他的事。\n阿拉夫：官员们嘲笑美国增加对伊拉克反对派支持的计划。\n阿齐兹：让他们在那些骗子身上花更多的钱。如果他们在美国预算中有盈余可以花在那些人身上，而不是花在美国的医疗保健或教育上，那就让他们花那笔钱。\n阿拉夫：伊拉克表示，白宫里是谁对这里的政府来说无关紧要，但问题如此敏感，以至于不允许记者询问伊拉克人对新美国总统的看法。\n不过，伊拉克将密切关注新美国政府，就像政府密切关注伊拉克一样。简·阿拉夫，CNN，巴格达。\n沃尔科特：现在我们睁开眼睛，欣赏牙买加的自然美景，这个位于西印度群岛的岛国。\n牙买加位于佛罗里达州以南480英里或772公里，是加勒比海第三大岛。其首都和最大城市金斯敦是该国的主要港口。\n牙买加曾是英国殖民地约300年，并于1962年成为独立国家。该岛的经济依赖于铝土矿、香蕉、糖和其他制造品的生产。\n但旅游业也是经济的基石。牙买加宜人的气候和美丽的海滩每年吸引超过85万游客。卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔告诉我们原因。\n卡琳·托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN记者（画外音）：牙买加郁郁葱葱的景观充满了冒险旅行者的挑战。\n该岛最受欢迎的景点之一是奥乔里奥斯的邓恩河瀑布。你不仅仅是看这些瀑布，你还要攀登它们。\n每天大约有2500名游客接受600英尺滑石的挑战。许多游客来自游轮。\n默尔·威尔逊，邓恩河瀑布和公园经理：这对牙买加来说是件好事。旅游业是我们主要的外汇领域。因此，游轮游客对邓恩河非常特别，因为我们真的是他们来这里的原因。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：各个年龄段的人都在跋涉。你所需要的只是一个经验丰富的导游，合适的鞋子，泳衣或轻便的衣服和冒险精神。\n沿途有几个休息点可以拍照，几乎每个人都能到达顶端。\n未透露姓名的女性：很吓人，但非常棒。\n未透露姓名的女性：我爱邓恩河瀑布，我爱牙买加。\n威尔逊：有时我看到一些人攀登瀑布时感到惊讶，因为所有瀑布的大小都不同。这是一次非常令人振奋的体验，就像那样。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（镜头前）：现在，如果你还没有准备好迎接邓恩河瀑布的急流，这里有更平静的水域。\n在蒙特哥湾，玛莎布雷河让你可以坐下来欣赏风景。（画外音）：这条温和的水道以一位拒绝向西班牙入侵者透露金矿位置的阿拉瓦克印第安人命名。\n传说她在这条河中淹死了自己，并带走了西班牙人。如今，淹没在乐趣和放松中是主题。\n导游，或称为船长，通过提供牙买加历史和文化的花絮来增加体验；例如，解释牙买加人如何使用香料树的叶子。\n未透露姓名的男性：如果你胃不舒服，你只需咀嚼叶子。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：我们漂过一个纪念品摊，停下来喝一杯清爽的椰子水。牙买加人说它可以净化身体。\n你甚至可以在木筏上购买一个纪念品。（镜头前）：你在哪里学会这样做的？\n未透露姓名的男性：就在这里工作时学会的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在河上？\n未透露姓名的男性：是的。\n托马斯-塞缪尔（画外音）：在旅程结束时，一曲小夜曲是一个不错的收尾。\n未透露姓名的男性（唱歌）：薰衣草蓝，滴滴，薰衣草绿。当我是国王时，滴滴，你将是我的王后。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：晚上，在尼格瑞尔的西海岸，观看日落在里克咖啡馆是一项长期传统。\n未透露姓名的男性：人们会从蒙特哥湾和奥乔里奥斯开车过来，有时需要三到四个小时，来看我们。我们一直都很忙。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在客人等待日落时，他们享受里克的牙买加美食，并随着雷鬼音乐的节奏摇摆。\n更大胆的游客可以从50英尺高的悬崖跳下。但当地人比他们更胜一筹，爬得更高，从树上跳下。\n未透露姓名的女性：我听说了很多关于它的事情。它真的是他们所说的一切。\n托马斯-塞缪尔：在牙买加，乐趣不取决于天气。\n未透露姓名的男性：我见过250人在阴云密布的天空下举杯，正当太阳应该落在地平线时。没关系，伙计。在牙买加，一切都很酷，伙计。\n托马斯-塞缪尔，CNN，尼格瑞尔，牙买加。\n汤姆·海恩斯，联合主持人：苏联在1991年解体。剩下的是大俄罗斯和10个前苏联共和国。\n解体后，俄罗斯声称这些共和国是新独立国家联合体的一部分。\n但那些不想成为新俄罗斯联邦一部分的人之间很快出现了种族争端，紧张局势随之而来。\n为了提供道德指导，俄罗斯东正教在多年共产主义压迫后重新建立。\n自那时以来，其他宗教也重新出现。史蒂夫·哈里根报道了一种宗教的回归。\n史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN记者（画外音）：当新生婴儿马克·西格尔（音）和他的家人离开俄罗斯前往美国时，犹太人正在寻找宗教自由。\n现在他们回到莫斯科庆祝马克的成人礼。\n未透露姓名的男性：我觉得这真的像我的家。\n哈里根：一个社区，其成员在旧苏联经常试图隐藏他们的身份或移民到西方，现在在家中扮演一个新的、更公开的角色。\n贝尔·拉扎尔，俄罗斯首席拉比：数字是惊人的。今天我们相信我们与超过一百万犹太人有联系。\n哈里根：俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京帮助揭幕了一个价值1200万美元的犹太社区中心，位于过去10年中被炸两次和烧一次的犹太教堂的同一地点。\n这位前克格勃上校称几十年的国家迫害是荒谬的。\n弗拉基米尔·普京，俄罗斯总统（通过翻译）：人们被迫在地下秘密学习自己的语言。谁会住在这样的国家？\n哈里根：今天希伯来语课程是公开的，但并不是所有犹太人都欢迎政府的拥抱。竞争派系说，俄罗斯的新首席拉比是克里姆林宫挑选的。\n平卡斯·戈尔德施密特，莫斯科首席拉比：我们看到一个非常悠久的传统——俄罗斯传统——不仅是共产主义的，一个非常悠久的俄罗斯传统，试图控制和影响宗教团体。\n哈里根：如果这种传统仍然存在，方法肯定已经改变，从几年前的公开暴力到今天的微笑和握手。史蒂夫·哈里根，CNN，莫斯科。\n鲁迪·巴赫蒂亚尔，联合主持人：更多来自俄罗斯的报道，我们转向野生王国。我们看看狗科动物中最大的成员之一，狼。\n狼通常生活在人口稀少的北部地区，如阿拉斯加、中国和俄罗斯。它们是狩猎专家，主要捕食大型动物，包括鹿、麋鹿和驼鹿。\n狼在外观上类似于大型德国牧羊犬。它们的毛色从北极的纯白色到亚北极森林的漆黑色不等。\n这些捕食者生活在称为群体的群体中，群体中有8到20个成员。群体的社会秩序涉及一个主导的等级制度，其中每只狼都有一定的等级。\n高等级的称为主导狼支配低等级的成员，或从属狼。但高等级不足以保护这些动物免受人类捕食者的侵害。\n加里·斯特里克解释。\n加里·斯特里克，CNN记者（画外音）：在他的后院，米哈伊尔·斯塔达杜普塞夫（音）有几个孤儿：五只他在一个巢穴中发现的狼崽，当时它们只有几天大。\n他喜欢给它们他的狗玩，尽管狗似乎知道如果狼再大一点，它们可能会吃掉它。\n米哈伊尔在俄罗斯西南部当了50多年的森林护林员。他说他喜欢狼，但他承认他在他的时间里杀了很多狼，包括这些狼崽的母亲。\n他在他的工具棚里有一个小狼展览，算是他对这些动物的感情的见证。\n他说：“狼就像森林中的卫生清洁工，捕食病弱的动物。它们的存在是必要的，”他说，“但当它们太多时，必须杀掉一些。”\n这在俄罗斯已经是几百年的政策。杀狼让鹿和野猪等猎物动物得以繁殖。这是人类猎人想要的。\n政府仍然向任何在保护区外杀死狼的人支付赏金。但莫斯科的官员说，俄罗斯的狼仍然太多；根据最后的统计，全国有超过44,000只狼。\n去年仅有近13,000只狼被杀。但官员们声称这还不足以控制它们。\n他们说没有资金用于运输、燃料和武器来完成这项工作。但在俄罗斯有一个日益增长的运动，受到西方新生态思维的影响，\n这将赋予狼在这些森林中更大的角色，允许狼与猎物之间的自然平衡。\n但野生动物生物学家安德烈·波亚尔科夫（音）说，许多俄罗斯人仍然对狼深感恐惧，他预计每年的狼杀戮将继续，甚至增加。\n米哈伊尔说他会把这些狼放回森林，让它们像其他所有狼一样面对赏金猎人的挑战。加里·斯特里克，CNN，博尔达内兹（音），俄罗斯。\n沃尔科特：对新美国总统来说，这是一个重要的周末。就职典礼并没有止于布什总统的宣誓就职。\n这一天的其余时间包括游行、教堂服务和派对、派对、派对。我们派遣了我们的华盛顿新闻室记者迈克·麦克马纳斯去就职舞会，了解年轻人希望在这个新政府中实现什么。\n迈克·麦克马纳斯，CNN记者（画外音）：布什总统的就职演讲围绕着一个与他的竞选活动熟悉的问题。\n布什：我们的团结，我们的联盟是每一代领导者和公民的严肃工作。这是我庄严的承诺：我将努力建设一个正义和机会的单一国家。\n麦克马纳斯：弗里茨·布罗根是一名16岁，对这个问题非常熟悉。\n弗里茨·布罗根，16岁：是时候庆祝了。这是一场漫长而艰难的比赛，但它结束了。\n麦克马纳斯：他来自佛罗里达州劳德代尔堡，选举重新计票的中心。布罗根在佛罗里达州的就职舞会上庆祝了就职之夜。\n布罗根：在选举期间，很多人的脚趾被踩过。许多人认为他们的投票权被牺牲了。但我认为，乔治·W·布什可以很好地将美国重新团结起来。\n麦克马纳斯：布罗根是布什的支持者，并积极参与了他的总统竞选活动。这位高中二年级学生甚至专门为对布什-切尼票感兴趣的青少年创建了自己的网站。\n布罗根：互联网是团结青少年的唯一事物。几乎每个人都有一台电脑和电子邮件地址，所以我能够联系全国各地，甚至全世界的孩子。\n麦克马纳斯（镜头前）：将两个深度分裂的政党团结在一起可能是总统的首要任务。但与任何领导者一样，成功不会仅仅通过承诺来衡量。年轻选民正在寻找结果。你会让他兑现这些承诺吗？\n布罗根：我会让他兑现他的承诺，是的。\n麦克马纳斯（画外音）：其他年轻的派对参与者对新总统改革美国教育系统的竞选承诺更感兴趣。\n布什：我们将共同收复美国的学校，以免无知和冷漠夺走更多年轻的生命。\n凯特琳·沙利文，18岁：每个学生都应该有机会就读最适合他们的学校，最适合他们的学习风格。\n杰米·布洛瑟，16岁：我喜欢他关于不让任何人掉队的观点。每个孩子都应该接受教育，无论他们是富裕还是贫穷，无论他们住在哪里。我认为这非常重要。\n麦克马纳斯：另一个关注点是布什总统对经济放缓的看法。\n布什：我们将减税以恢复我们经济的动力，并奖励努力工作的美国人的努力和企业。\n克里斯·鲁德，21岁：这对我很重要，因为我——所以我长大后有工作，你知道，保持工作并有一个家庭。\n麦克马纳斯：这些年轻人聚集在一起参加就职典礼，他们对新政府带到华盛顿的想法感到兴奋，但也知道1600宾夕法尼亚大道和国会山面临挑战。\n布什在演讲结束时呼应了这些挑战。\n布什：这项工作继续进行，故事继续……\n麦克马纳斯：迈克尔·麦克马纳斯，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：在电视上看到的总统就职典礼的所有盛况和仪式，你可以想象亲自参加的兴奋。\n但如果你在高中乐队中，而总统就职委员会邀请你为新总统表演呢？我们的杰森·贝利尼报道了“兴奋”和“紧张”这两个词有了全新的意义。\n杰森·贝利尼，CNN记者（画外音）：对于在就职游行中行进的乐队来说，这一天从五角大楼的一个停车场开始得很早。\n就职委员会选择了30支高中和大学乐队，有幸为新总统表演。我跟随了一天的内布拉斯加州奥马哈市帕皮利恩-拉维斯塔高中的乐队。\n如果你是一支乐队，能一路走到这里，你就知道你是最好的乐队之一。因此，当乐队在热身时，他们互相打量。\n乐队花了25个小时才到达华盛顿特区，大多数人在路上没有怎么睡觉。\n未透露姓名的男性：我们要去国家广场。\n贝利尼：有70多名成员，他们对他们的乐队指挥来说是一个挑战。\n未透露姓名的男性：无论我告诉你做什么，我们都需要立即去做，好吗？有任何问题吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：凯勒先生（音），我有个问题。你知道百事乐队住在哪里吗？\n贝利尼（镜头前）：这些孩子表现如何？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。\n贝利尼：是吗？\n未透露姓名的男性：非常好。你打赌。不能更好。\n贝利尼：公共汽车上没有胡闹？\n未透露姓名的男性：哦，绝对没有，绝对没有。\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，天哪，不！哦，天哪，不！\n贝利尼：你不会容忍那样的行为？\n未透露姓名的男性：不，确实如此。\n贝利尼（画外音）：上午11点，公共汽车离开五角大楼，开往国家广场。游行的安全措施异常严格，警察封锁了乐队巴士车队的街道。\n未透露姓名的女性：你知道我们真的像闯了红灯吗？\n未透露姓名的女性：哦，这很紧张。\n贝利尼：大多数乐队成员通过他们的巴士窗户第一次看到他们的国家首都。\n未透露姓名的女性：我以为我永远不会看到白宫。\n贝利尼：没有人事先告诉他们，国家广场没有Gap或Bloomingdale's。\n未透露姓名的女性：我准备好去购物了。\n未透露姓名的女性：那是个商场？\n未透露姓名的女性：我们要去购物。没有，没有商场。\n未透露姓名的女性：你在开玩笑吗？\n贝利尼：他们来这里不仅对他们和他们的父母来说是一个大事件，对家乡的社区来说也是如此。他们的乐队，因此他们的社区，今天在地图上。\n未透露姓名的女性：我们有小学生。他们对钱很感兴趣，他们给我们旅行的钱——13美元的硬币。\n未透露姓名的女性：硬币。这是最可爱的事情。\n贝利尼：大约上午11:50，就职典礼开始。司机把收音机调到那里。\n从公共汽车到下一个帐篷，喝热巧克力，并有更多时间与其他乐队交流。蒂姆·科克林斯基（音）借用了我的相机一会儿，做了一些自己的采访。\n未透露姓名的女性：你们都来自哪里？\n未透露姓名的男性：内布拉斯加。\n未透露姓名的女性：内布拉斯加？哦。\n未透露姓名的男性：我不知道。我几乎每两周选择一个新颜色。\n未透露姓名的男性：我告诉你们，当我们开始时，这将是你们一生中最重要的事情之一。我不是在开玩笑。\n贝利尼：在激励讲话之后，荣誉变成了泥泞、寒冷的雨和湿脚的噩梦，然后他们才有机会与新总统面对面。\n你会认为他们会在巴士一出现就冲上去，但帕皮利恩高中行进乐队保持队形，这次为自己和他们的司机做了最后一个节目。\n他们很棒，他们知道，现在他们要回家了。杰森·贝利尼，CNN新闻室，华盛顿。\n沃尔科特：这将是一个终生难忘的记忆。现在这个节目是一个记忆。我们明天见。再见。",
